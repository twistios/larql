# Residual Stream Trace

The residual stream is the single wire through a transformer. Attention writes to it. FFN reads from it. The answer emerges from it. The trace is the complete record of what happened during inference — every waypoint, every contribution, queryable at any point.

## Architecture

```
Node:   residual state at (layer, position) — a 2560D vector
Edges:  attn_delta (what attention added) + ffn_delta (post-attention contribution)

residual[L] = residual[L-1] + attn_delta[L] + ffn_delta[L]
```

The trace is a DAG with `tokens x layers` nodes and two types of edges:
- **Vertical (FFN):** per-position knowledge retrieval
- **Horizontal (attention):** cross-position information routing

`ffn_delta` is named for the dominant mechanism, but its contract is
additive faithfulness: it stores everything after attention that is needed to
reconstruct the layer residual exactly. For plain decoder blocks that is the
FFN write. For architectures with PLE, post-feedforward norms, or residual
scales, those terms are included in `ffn_delta` rather than dropped.

### Markov Property

Each layer's residual depends only on the previous layer's residual plus the current layer's deltas. Old token chains are complete and frozen — they never change. This makes the trace append-only.

## Implementation

### Rust Engine

```
crates/larql-inference/src/trace/
  mod.rs       — module root
  types.rs     — TraceNode, ResidualTrace, AnswerWaypoint, LayerSummary
  capture.rs   — decomposed forward pass recording attn/FFN deltas
  store.rs     — mmap'd append-only binary store (full chains)
  boundary.rs  — mmap'd boundary residual store (10 KB per window)
  context.rs   — tiered context store with critical layer deltas
  vocab.rs     — vocabulary projection helpers
```

### Python Bindings

```
crates/larql-python/src/trace_py.rs
  PyResidualTrace    — queryable trace object
  PyAnswerWaypoint   — per-layer answer state
  PyLayerSummary     — compact per-layer overview
  PyTraceStore       — mmap'd full chain reader
  PyBoundaryStore    — mmap'd boundary residual reader
  PyBoundaryWriter   — append-only boundary writer
```

## Usage

### LQL

```sql
-- Answer trajectory: track Paris through all 34 layers
TRACE "The capital of France is" FOR "Paris";

-- Attn vs FFN decomposition at the phase transition
TRACE "The capital of France is" DECOMPOSE LAYERS 22-27;

-- Full decomposition, all layers
TRACE "The capital of France is" DECOMPOSE;

-- Save to mmap'd file; saved traces require complete token chains
TRACE "The capital of France is" POSITIONS ALL SAVE "france.trace";

-- All positions, specific layer range, with answer tracking
TRACE "The capital of France is" FOR "Paris" LAYERS 20-33 POSITIONS ALL;
```

The LQL TRACE command uses the same backend as INFER — mutations via INSERT/DELETE are reflected in trace results.

### Python: Capture a trace

```python
import larql

wm = larql.WalkModel("gemma3-4b.vindex")
t = wm.trace("The capital of France is")
# ResidualTrace('The capital of France is', 6 tokens, 34 layers, 35 nodes)
```

### Python: Query the answer trajectory

```python
traj = t.answer_trajectory("Paris")
for w in traj:
    if w.layer >= 22:
        print(w)
# AnswerWaypoint(L22, rank=50,  prob=0.002, attn=22.2,  ffn=34.4)
# AnswerWaypoint(L23, rank=10,  prob=0.024, attn=-16.9, ffn=55.9)
# AnswerWaypoint(L24, rank=1,   prob=0.714, attn=105.7, ffn=24.4)
# AnswerWaypoint(L25, rank=1,   prob=0.997, attn=4.3,   ffn=94.4)
# AnswerWaypoint(L26, rank=1,   prob=0.999, attn=83.1,  ffn=18.7)
```

### Python: Inspect any layer

```python
t.top_k(24)        # [('Paris', 0.714), ('located', 0.133), ...]
t.rank_of("Paris", 23)  # 10
t.residual(24)      # [f32; 2560] — the raw vector
t.attn_delta(24)    # [f32; 2560] — what attention added
t.ffn_delta(24)     # [f32; 2560] — post-attention contribution
```

### Python: Multi-position trace

```python
t = wm.trace("The capital of France is", positions="all")
# 210 nodes (6 tokens x 35 layers)
t.residual(24, position=4)  # France's residual at L24
```

### Python: Save and mmap

```python
from larql._native import TraceStore

t.save("trace.bin")  # save requires positions="all"
store = TraceStore("trace.bin")
# TraceStore(6 tokens, 34 layers, 2560D, 6.5 MB)
store.residual(5, 25)   # token 5, layer 25 — zero-copy from mmap
```

### Python: Boundary store (production context)

```python
from larql._native import BoundaryWriter, BoundaryStore

writer = BoundaryWriter("context.bndx", hidden_size=2560, window_size=200)
writer.append(token_offset=0, window_tokens=200, residual=boundary_vec)
writer.finish()

store = BoundaryStore("context.bndx")
# BoundaryStore(1850 boundaries, 370000 tokens, 18.5 MB data, window=200)
store.residual(42)  # boundary 42 — zero-copy from mmap
```

## Key Findings

### The Phase Transition (L24-L26)

The answer does not exist in the residual stream until layer 24. Then it appears in a sudden phase transition:

| Layer   | % top-1 | Mean P(answer) | Event                             |
|---------|---------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| L22     | 0%      | 0.001          | Nothing                           |
| L23     | 3%      | 0.010          | FFN fires (+56 logits)            |
| **L24** | **30%** | **0.258**      | **Attention fires (+106 logits)** |
| **L25** | **60%** | **0.514**      | **FFN fires (+94 logits)**        |
| **L26** | **84%** | **0.796**      | Both fire together                |
| L27     | 91%     | 0.813          | Stabilizing                       |

Attention and FFN alternate: attention fires at even layers (L24, L26), FFN at every layer but especially odd layers (L23, L25, L27). A two-stroke engine.

### Attention vs FFN Decomposition

Across the full forward pass:
- **L0-L6:** FFN constructs, attention navigates (both positive, small)
- **L7-L13:** Attention positions, FFN neutral (encoding phase)
- **L14-L22:** Both start pushing answer, accelerating (knowledge layers)
- **L23-L27:** Alternating fire — phase transition
- **L28-L31:** FFN stabilizes, attention calibrates
- **L32:** Both destructive (confidence adjustment)
- **L33:** Recovery

FFN contributes ~60% of total answer signal, attention ~40%.

### Residual Stream Trajectory

The residual norm grows monotonically from 53 (embedding) to 66,638 (L33). The answer's rank trajectory:

```
Embedding:    rank 2     (latent knowledge in token embeddings)
L0-L13:       rank ~50K  (encoding — representations being built)
L14-L22:      rank ~600  (narrowing — knowledge layers positioning)
L23-L26:      rank 1     (phase transition — answer crystallizes)
L27-L33:      rank 1     (stable — refinement and calibration)
```

## Tiered Context Storage

The trace enables tiered storage for infinite context without KV cache:

| Tier     | Content                        | Per window | 370K tokens | Compression | Accuracy                 |
|----------|--------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1        | Boundary residual              | 10 KB      | 18.9 MB     | 3,100x      | 13/15 (no replay needed) |
| 3        | + deltas L23-27                | 110 KB     | 199 MB      | 282x        | 13/15 (0.97 cos)         |
| 4        | + deltas L23-33                | 230 KB     | 416 MB      | 135x        | 15/15 (bit-perfect)      |
| 4+int8   | Template + quantized residuals | 58 KB      | 110 MB      | 511x        | 12/12 (0.9999 cos)       |
| Hybrid   | Tier 1 default + int8 Tier 4   | mixed      | 55 MB       | 1,012x      | full                     |
| KV cache | Q,K per token per layer        | ~30 MB/win | 56,000 MB   | 1x          | full                     |

### How Tier 4 Works

Tier 4 is not an approximation. It's the additive property of the residual stream:

```
residual[L33] = residual[L22] + Σ(attn_delta[l] + ffn_delta[l]) for l in 23..33
```

Store the L22 residual and all deltas for L23-L33. Reconstruct by addition. Mathematically exact.

### Template Compression

Entity trajectories have 0.99 cosine similarity. Store one template (mean delta per slot), then delta-encode each window's deviation:

```
stored[window] = template + quantize(actual - template)
```

At int8 quantization: 58 KB/window, 0.9999 cosine to ground truth.

### Template Compression Detail

Not all vectors compress equally:

| Vector type                  | Template cosine | Compresses well?                      |
|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| L22 boundary residual        | 0.996           | Yes (12x)                             |
| Attention deltas L25,L27-L29 | 0.98+           | Yes (5-9x)                            |
| FFN deltas L24-L28           | 0.55            | No (1.2x) — entity-specific knowledge |
| Attention deltas L24,L26     | 0.64-0.81       | Partially                             |

The FFN deltas are where the knowledge lives. They can't be templated away — each entity activates different FFN features.

## Connection to Existing Work

The trace connects several proven findings:

- **Hourglass architecture:** encoder (L0-13), bottleneck (L13-14), decoder (L14-27), output (L28-33). The phase transition at L24-26 is the decoder-output boundary.
- **99% template-fixed attention:** confirmed by direct measurement. Attention patterns are a function of the template, not the entity.
- **FFN cached 4160x:** the FFN deltas in the trace are exactly what the vindex walk FFN computes. The trace stores the result; the vindex enables the lookup.
- **Gate vectors full rank:** the FFN uses all 2560 dimensions. Entity-specific FFN deltas can't be templated — they're the knowledge.
- **8 circuits / 192 OV edges:** the attention deltas at L24 and L26 (+106, +83 logits) are the circuit outputs. The two biggest attention events in the entire forward pass.
- **LQL integration:** TRACE uses the same WalkFfn backend as INFER — mutations via INSERT/DELETE are reflected in trace results. The knowledge graph and the inference trace are consistent.
