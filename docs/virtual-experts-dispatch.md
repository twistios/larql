# Virtual Experts: Turning Local Tool Use into Expert Routing

> Virtual experts are not normal tool calls. They are bounded routing
> decisions into typed, sandboxed compute units.

A writeup of the work to take the WASM-experts subsystem from "scaffolding
present, no production wiring" to "end-to-end tool dispatch through
`larql run --experts`, validated on Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3."

This document captures *what was built*, *why*, and *what we learned along
the way* — particularly the production findings about model capacity and
prompt design that aren't obvious from the code alone.

## TL;DR

`larql run --experts` now performs real end-to-end tool dispatch: a model
emits a structured op-call, the host parses it, resolves it through a
dispatcher, a WASM expert executes it under wasmtime, and the result is
returned to stdout.

The load-bearing lesson is that reliable local tool use isn't a prompting
problem. It depends on five things working together — correct chat-template
wrapping, scoped op vocabularies, visible argument schemas, tolerant
parsing, and (for weak models) constrained decoding. Mistral 7B Instruct
v0.3 Q4K works end-to-end today with focused op subsets; smaller Q4K
models hit the constrained-decode wall. See
[§Production findings: what actually mattered](#production-findings-what-actually-mattered)
before betting on this in a deployment.

```
user prompt
  → ChatTemplate (Gemma/Mistral/Llama/ChatML/Plain auto-detected from vindex)
  → ExpertSession::build_prompt with arg-schema-aware system prompt
  → tokenize + Metal Q4K decode (or CPU Q4K, or CPU F32)
  → parse_op_call (handles Mistral comma drops, fullwidth punctuation,
    code fences, escaped quotes inside string args)
  → ExpertSession::dispatch via Dispatcher trait
  → wasmtime → WASM expert → ExpertResult
```

Mentally: the model is not being asked to use a tool; it is being asked to
route into a small advertised expert table. That turns tool use from an
open-ended generation problem into a bounded selection-and-argument
problem.

End-to-end demonstration:

```
$ echo "What is the GCD of 144 and 60?" \
    | larql run <vindex> --experts --metal --ops gcd,is_prime,factorial,to_roman
{"args":{"a":144,"b":60},"expert_id":"arithmetic","op":"gcd","value":12}
```

13 seconds to load + decode + dispatch on Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 Q4K via
Metal on M-series Mac. 867 lib tests + 96 CLI tests pass; 2 integration
tests gated behind `--ignored` exercise the full path against a real model.

## What this is, beyond `larql run`

The shape of the work is "tool use as expert routing, not best-effort
prose parsing." We're still parsing — but we're parsing a deliberately
constrained op-call format, not retrofitting structure onto whatever
freeform text the model produced. The model picks an operation from a
bounded vocabulary the host advertises, and the host owns parsing,
dispatch decision, sandbox, and result formatting.

Read this way, WASM experts sit closer to MoE experts than to
traditional chat-style tools — they're callable, typed, sandboxed, and
swappable behind a single dispatch trait. The routing substrate is
analogous, even though the expert implementation is not: neural experts
are weight shards selected by a learned router, while WASM experts are
host-executed programs selected by op name. Both are forms of routing
decisions to specialised callable units. The fact that
`crates/larql-inference/src/ffn/moe_remote.rs` (MoE weight sharding) and
`crates/larql-inference/src/experts/` (WASM compute experts) now coexist
cleanly under disambiguated names — Phase 3 of this work — makes that
parallel structurally explicit.

**Why WASM as the boundary?** Because experts should be portable,
sandboxed modules with an explicit ABI. The model shouldn't need to know
how an op is implemented; it only needs to select the op and supply the
advertised args. WASM is a good fit for that boundary: deterministic
execution, host-controlled memory, low language coupling (today every
expert is Rust, but a Zig, C, TinyGo, or other WASI-compatible language
could plug in behind the same ABI), and trust + validation + resource
control land back on the host where they belong.

The `Dispatcher` trait is therefore the load-bearing abstraction.
Anything that resolves an op-name + args to a result can plug in:

  - `ExpertRegistry` — local WASM experts (today)
  - `FilteredDispatcher` — narrowed allowlist (today)
  - `Box<dyn Dispatcher>` — runtime composition (today)
  - `ConstrainedDispatcher` — vocabulary-masked decode lift (next)
  - `CachedDispatcher` — memoise pure ops
  - `AuditedDispatcher` — log every call for replay
  - `RateLimitedDispatcher` — quota / cost guards
  - `RemoteDispatcher` — RPC to a sandboxed worker pool

That gives the expert layer the same middleware shape HTTP clients have.
It's the right substrate for a local virtual-expert runtime — the rest
of this document is the production work to make the trait load-bearing
instead of theoretical.

## Starting state

Going in:

- **`crates/larql-experts/`** — a nested workspace with 19 WASM cdylibs
  (arithmetic, conway, date, …) targeting `wasm32-wasip1`, sharing the
  `expert-interface` crate. Each cdylib advertised metadata as a flat
  `Vec<String>` of op names.
- **`crates/larql-inference/src/experts/`** — `ExpertRegistry` with
  wasmtime + lazy instantiation + `.cwasm` cache. A handful of dispatch
  test files (`test_expert_dispatch`, `test_constrained_dispatch`,
  `test_llm_dispatch`, `test_trie_dispatch`) duplicating an `extract_json`
  helper four different ways.

Four architectural issues:

1. **Name collision.** `larql_inference::experts::ExpertRegistry` (WASM
   compute experts) and `larql_inference::ffn::RemoteExpertBackend` (MoE
   weight sharding) shared the word "expert" in the same crate. Grepping
   was painful and code review was confused.
2. **Zero production wiring.** Despite a 1.3K-line `test_experts.rs`
   exercising 175 ops, no CLI subcommand instantiated a registry. The only
   way to use the system was to write a Rust test.
3. **External path leak.** `test_trie_dispatch.rs:49` read its probe from
   `../../lazarus-play/experiments/cascade_trie_<slug>_probe.json` — a
   sibling-repo path with no documentation or skip-on-missing UX.
4. **Duplicated parser.** Three test files reimplemented JSON extraction
   from model output. Only the trie-test version handled Mistral's
   missing-comma-before-`"args"` quirk and fullwidth-punctuation
   normalization.

## Phase 1–4: foundational cleanups

### Phase 1 — `parse_op_call`

Extracted to `larql_inference::experts::parser`. Returns
`Option<OpCall { op, args }>` so callers don't all reimplement the
"validate `op` is a string" pattern.

The implementation is brace-depth-aware (skips `{` inside string values,
respects `\"` escapes), normalises fullwidth `，:` to ASCII `,:`, and
patches `…"value"args":` (Mistral) by inserting the missing comma. It
walks multiple top-level `{...}` blocks and returns the first one with a
valid string `op` field — so models that emit a preamble or a code-fence
wrapper still parse cleanly.

17 unit tests cover happy paths, every malformation we've seen in the
wild, and explicit reject paths (no object, no `op`, non-string `op`,
unbalanced braces).

### Phase 2 — Cascade trie probe

The probe artefact is per-model and 1.8–2.9 MB. Vendoring all three
(Gemma, Llama, Mistral) into git would add ~7 MB; gating behind git-lfs
felt heavy for one test. Solution: refactor `CascadeTrie::find` to consult
a precedence chain — `LARQL_PROBE_PATH` → `LARQL_PROBE_DIR` →
caller-supplied search dirs. Add a gitignored `tests/data/` directory with
a README explaining how to populate it and where probes are exported from
the sibling `lazarus-play` repo. The test then skips with regen
instructions when no probe is found.

A pure `find_with_env` variant takes env-var values as parameters so the
precedence chain can be unit-tested without env mutation (which would race
with parallel tests). 5 unit tests cover all four precedence outcomes.

### Phase 3 — MoE rename

`ffn/remote_expert.rs` → `ffn/moe_remote.rs`. Type renames:
`RemoteExpertBackend` → `RemoteMoeBackend`, `RemoteExpertError` →
`RemoteMoeError`, `generate_with_remote_experts` →
`generate_with_remote_moe`, `examples/expert_grid_generate.rs` →
`examples/moe_grid_generate.rs`. Module doc explicitly disambiguates from
`crate::experts`.

Side-effect of running the rename: caught two pre-existing build breakages
where `MoeRouterWeights` had grown new fields (`router_norm_parameter_free`,
`router_input_scalar`) without their callers being updated, and
`rms_norm_no_weight` was referenced but undefined. Both fixed inline so
the workspace builds clean.

### Phase 4 — CLI wiring

Added `larql_inference::prompt::ChatTemplate` (5 variants:
Gemma/Mistral/Llama/ChatML/Plain) with two resolution paths:
`for_model_id(&str)` for HF-style identifiers and `for_family(&str)` when
a `ModelArchitecture` is in scope.

Added `larql_inference::experts::ExpertSession` that owns a registry,
builds the system prompt, wraps with a chat template, and dispatches
parsed op-calls. Returns a structured `Result<DispatchOutcome,
DispatchSkip>` so callers can distinguish "model didn't try"
(`NoOpCall`), "model named a missing op" (`UnknownOp`), and "expert
declined the args" (`ExpertDeclined`).

Wired through `larql-cli/src/commands/primary/run_cmd.rs` as
`larql run --experts`. A `Strategy` enum picks between three decode paths:

| vindex quant | `--metal` | strategy                   | why                                              |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Q4_K         | yes       | `layer_graph::generate`    | Metal prefill + KV-cached decode                 |
| Q4_K         | no        | `vindex::generate_q4k_cpu` | per-step `predict_q4k` loop, no KV cache → O(N²) |
| f32          | any       | `forward::generate_cached` | CPU F32, KV-cached                               |

Plus chat mode (REPL on stdin) when no prompt is given. Loads the model
once, dispatches per turn.

## Test coverage hardening

After Phase 4 shipped, an honest audit surfaced five gaps where critical
code wasn't really covered. All five closed:

1. **`pick_strategy`** was a private impure function (called
   `default_backend()` internally). Refactored into `metal_ready_for_q4`
   (impure) + `pick_strategy(quant, metal_ready)` (pure). 4 tests cover
   the 2×2 quant × metal-ready matrix.

2. **`resolve_experts_dir` precedence** — same approach.
   `resolve_experts_dir_inner(arg_dir, env_dir, exe_path)` takes the
   inputs directly; the public wrapper just plumbs from process state.
   5 tests cover arg-valid, arg-invalid, env-fallthrough, workspace-walk,
   all-fail.

3. **`CascadeTrie::find` env paths** — already factored as
   `find_with_env` in Phase 2. 5 additional tests cover env_path-wins,
   env_path-falls-through, env_dir-wins, env_dir-falls-through, all-empty.

4. **MoE `router_norm_parameter_free=true`** — new codepath added to
   `MoeRouterWeights::route` that calls `rms_norm_no_weight`. Direct test
   covers HF Gemma 4 codepath. Bonus test for `router_input_scalar`
   non-1.0 to prove the scalar actually multiplies through.

5. **`ExpertSession` mock** — the previous tests all required the WASM
   build dir on disk and skipped otherwise, so a fresh checkout had ~0%
   session coverage. The dispatch path is now built around a small
   `Dispatcher` trait so the same `ExpertSession` can be composed with
   filtering, mocking, and (eventually) auditing/caching/rate-limiting
   middleware. Introduced the trait, made `ExpertSession` generic over
   it (with `Default = ExpertRegistry` for backwards compat), and added a
   `MockDispatcher` in tests with canned responses + call recording.
   10 mock-backed tests run unconditionally.

## Integration tests

Two end-to-end tests added, both `#[ignore]`d by default with skip-on-
missing-prerequisites for clean CI behaviour:

- **`test_generate_q4k_cpu`** (`larql-inference`) — loads a real Q4K
  vindex, runs `generate_q4k_cpu` for 4 tokens, asserts non-empty output.
  Validated against Gemma 3 4B Q4K: 4 tokens in 393s on CPU (98s/tok,
  expected for the O(N²) per-step path).

- **`experts_chat_mode_dispatches_via_stdin`** (`larql-cli`) — spawns
  `larql run --experts` with no prompt arg, pipes a prompt over stdin,
  asserts dispatch evidence appears in stdout/stderr. Validated against
  Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 Q4K: 13s end-to-end including model load.

Both honour `LARQL_TEST_VINDEX=<path>` for explicit override.

## The args-schema epic

The chat-mode test ran end-to-end on the first try — but Mistral 7B
emitted `{"op":"gcd","args":{"144":144,"60":60}}` instead of
`{"a":144,"b":60}`. The pipeline correctly extracted the call,
correctly dispatched, and the expert correctly declined because the keys
didn't match. The system worked; the model didn't know the parameter
names because the system prompt only listed op names, not signatures.

Fix: extend the WASM ABI to advertise per-op argument schemas.

### ABI change

`ExpertMetadata::ops` changed from `Vec<String>` to `Vec<OpSpec>` where
`OpSpec { name: String, args: Vec<String> }`. The `expert_exports!` macro
grew new syntax:

```rust
ops = [
    ("gcd",      ["a", "b"]),
    ("is_prime", ["n"]),
    ("to_roman", ["n"]),
]
```

This is a breaking ABI change. All 19 expert crates were migrated.
~250 individual arg names enumerated by reading each expert's dispatch
function and extracting the `args.get("...")` calls.

Host-side `caller.rs` mirrored the change. `ExpertRegistry::op_specs()`
returns `Vec<&OpSpec>` sorted by name. The `Dispatcher` trait grew an
`op_specs()` method (and `MockDispatcher` was updated accordingly).

### System prompt redesign

The first attempt rendered ops as a multi-line list — `gcd(a, b)\n` per
line, ~3 KB total at 126 ops. Models collapsed into degenerate output
(Gemma 3 4B emitted `kennisk... ` — Dutch for "knowledge", repeated;
Mistral 7B Instruct emitted `1111111...`). The format was too verbose
and gave the model too many simultaneous choices.

The fix was to mirror the format already proven to work in
`test_llm_dispatch.rs`: dense, single-line, no example.

```
Respond with ONLY a JSON object {"op":"...","args":{...}}.
ops: factorial{"n"}, gcd{"a","b"}, is_leap_year{"year"}, is_prime{"n"}, to_roman{"n"}
No extra text.
```

Under 2 KB even with 100+ ops.

### `FilteredDispatcher` + `--ops` flag

Even with the dense format, 126 ops is too many choices for small models.
Real production users will want to scope: a math-chatbot wants
`gcd,lcm,factorial,is_prime,...` not all 126.

`FilteredDispatcher<D>` wraps any `Dispatcher` and exposes only an
allowlist of ops. Calls to non-allowed ops short-circuit to `None` (which
the session surfaces as `UnknownOp`). The CLI exposes this via
`--ops <CSV>`.

To let the CLI pick raw vs. filtered at runtime without duplicating
generation code, added `impl Dispatcher for Box<dyn Dispatcher>`. The CLI
holds `Box<dyn Dispatcher>` and the `ExpertSession` is generic enough to
own it.

## The `detect_template` bug

After all the above, Gemma 3 4B was *still* emitting garbage. Verbose
logging revealed `template: plain` — no chat template wrapping at all.

Root cause: `detect_template` called
`larql_models::detect_architecture(vindex_path)`, which looks for
`config.json`. Vindexes ship `index.json` instead (the `model_dir →
config.json` convention is for raw safetensors directories). So every
vindex was getting `ChatTemplate::Plain`, which is a passthrough.

Fix: read `vindex_path/index.json` directly and consume the `family`
field. Fall back to `model` for the substring heuristic, then to
`detect_architecture` for genuine safetensors dirs, then to `Plain`.

This was the root cause of "model produces gibberish." With the
detection fixed, the prompt fixed, the schema in place, and `--ops`
narrowing the choices, Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 Q4K dispatched correctly
on the first try.

**Generalisation worth remembering.** This is the kind of bug you get
when a workspace grows two file-layout conventions in parallel —
safetensors dirs (`config.json`) and vindexes (`index.json`) — and the
older shared utility (`detect_architecture`) only knows about one.
The same shape will recur: tokenizer-config detection, lm-head metadata,
quant-format probing. The right long-term fix is a single
`ModelLayout` resolver that knows both conventions; the short-term fix
in this work was just a vindex-aware shortcut in the consumer.

## Production findings: what actually mattered

The single most useful takeaway from this work: reliable local tool use
isn't a prompting problem. It's a small set of things that have to work
together, and missing any one of them collapses the whole pipeline:

  1. **Chat template correctness** — without family-correct wrapping
     every model degrades to garbage. See the `detect_template` debugging
     arc above.
  2. **Op vocabulary scoping** — 126 ops overwhelms small models; 5–15
     ops reliably narrows their decision. The `--ops` flag is a feature,
     not a workaround.
  3. **Argument schema visibility** — without per-op arg keys advertised
     in the prompt, models hallucinate keys. See the args-schema epic
     above.
  4. **Parser tolerance** — production model output is ragged: code
     fences, fullwidth punctuation, missing commas, escaped quotes inside
     string args. `parse_op_call` handles all of these without
     configuration.
  5. **Constrained decode** — the unlock for weak models. Wired today
     via `--constrained` (see
     [§Constrained decode: from generation to selection](#constrained-decode-from-generation-to-selection)).
     Lifts Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 Q4K from 2/4 → 4/4 on the demo set.

Orthogonal to those five — sitting under all of them — is **model capacity
+ instruction tuning**: at Q4K, 7B+ instruct works today, base models
don't, smaller instruct models need #5.

What follows are the empirical observations that produced that list.
They aren't visible from the code; they're what we learned by running
real models against the pipeline.

- **Q4K small models cannot do free-form tool use reliably *without
  constrained decode*.** Gemma 3 4B Q4K and Gemma 4 E2B Q4K both emit
  structurally-valid JSON but hallucinate op names (`gcdd`, `to_number`,
  `toRoman`) and fabricate arg keys (`base`, `output`, `maxLen`). This
  behaved like a model-capacity / instruction-following issue rather than
  a dispatch or parser issue — the prompts arrived correctly and the
  parser handled the malformed JSON cleanly. The fix is `--constrained`,
  documented in its own section below.
- **7B+ instruct models work end-to-end with `--constrained`.** Mistral 7B
  Instruct v0.3 Q4K dispatches all four demo prompts correctly with the
  flag on, including cases where its free-form prose answer would have
  been factually wrong. The model becomes a router; the WASM expert
  computes.
- **The `--ops` filter is a feature, not a workaround.** Even strong
  models do better with 5–15 ops than 126. Production deployments should
  always scope.
- **At Q4K, the base-vs-instruct gap is the dominant signal.** The
  local `mistral-7b-v0.1-q4k.vindex` (base, not instruct) was unusable
  for tool dispatch; the `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-q4k.vindex` worked
  perfectly. Don't assume a base-model vindex will follow instructions
  even with a good prompt — quantization isn't the issue, instruction
  tuning is. (We don't have a non-Q4K comparison point to claim Q4K
  amplifies the gap; that would need a separate experiment.)
- **Chat templates matter enormously.** Sending the prompt without
  template wrapping degraded all models to garbage output. Detection from
  the vindex's metadata is non-optional.

## Constrained decode: from generation to selection

The production findings predicted the unlock; this section is the work that
landed it. The four demo prompts that previously hit 2/4 on Mistral 7B
Instruct v0.3 Q4K now hit 4/4 — including the two prompts where the model's
own prose answer was factually wrong. With `--constrained`, the model's
job is reduced to picking an op + supplying args; the WASM expert
provides the deterministic computation.

### The mask

`larql_inference::experts::OpNameMask` was lifted from
`tests/test_constrained_dispatch.rs` (where it was named `OpJsonMask`)
and made public. It implements a tiny three-state grammar:

```
Free    → no `{"op":"` prefix seen yet, no constraint
OpName  → inside the op-name field, constrain to valid prefixes
Done    → past the closing quote, no constraint
```

Inside `OpName`, the mask zeroes (well, `f32::NEG_INFINITY`s) every token
id whose decoded string is *not* either a continuation of some valid op
name or the closing `"`. The candidate set (tokens whose characters are
a subset of any op name's characters) is computed once on first
in-op-name step — O(vocab_size) startup, O(candidate_set) per step.

Six unit tests cover the state-machine transitions on synthetic text;
no tokenizer needed for those. The decode-time path is exercised by the
existing `tests/test_constrained_dispatch.rs` integration test.

### Three decode paths

The mask is decode-strategy-agnostic — it just consumes generated token
ids and mutates a logits vector. Three production hooks consume it:

| Strategy   | Function                                                         | LM-head  |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| CPU F32    | `forward::generate_cached_constrained` (already existed)         | Dense    |
| CPU Q4K    | `vindex::generate_q4k_cpu_constrained` (new)                     | Dense    |
| Metal Q4K  | `layer_graph::generate_constrained` (new)                        | Dense*   |

\* The Metal path normally uses sparse vindex KNN over `lm_head` for
top-K, which is faster but cannot apply an arbitrary mask (a masked-out
token might be outside the KNN top-K). The constrained variant adds
`backend_lm_head_scores` — the same gemv that powers the unconstrained
path, just returning the full vocab-length score vector instead of
truncating. On Metal this is still ~3–5 ms per token for the Gemma 3
262K × 2560 tied LM head; the mask + argmax adds microseconds.

The CPU Q4K path needed `predict_q4k_hidden` as a small refactor —
extracting the per-layer dequantise-and-forward loop out of `predict_q4k`
so the constrained path can reuse it without duplicating ~120 lines of
attention-block-with-PLE-and-KV-sharing code.

### The bug we hit on the first attempt

Wiring the mask alone — `--constrained` on, mask active for all three
strategies — produced **the exact same 2/4 result**. Same successes
(`gcd`, `factorial`), same failures (`to_roman`, `is_prime`).

The mask only fires when the `OpName` state is reached, and that
requires the prefix `{"op":"` to appear in the generated text. On the
two failing prompts the model never chose to emit JSON at all — it
either echoed the system prompt's notation back at us
(`ops:to_roman{"2024"}\nargs:{"n":2024}…`) or wrote prose
(`Yes,97isnotaprimenumber.…`). The mask sat in `Free` state through
the whole decode, doing nothing.

The fix is **teacher forcing**: append `{"op":"` to the prompt before
tokenisation, so the model starts decoding *inside* the op-name field.
The mask is told via `set_seed_text` that the prefix is already there,
so it activates on the very first generated token.

```rust
// In Runtime::generate, when --constrained:
let effective_prompt = format!("{wrapped}{OP_CALL_PREFIX}");  // {"op":"
let token_ids = encode_prompt(&self.tokenizer, arch, &effective_prompt)?;
let mut mask = OpNameMask::new(ops.to_vec(), &self.tokenizer);
mask.set_seed_text(OP_CALL_PREFIX);
// ... generate ...
let result = format!("{OP_CALL_PREFIX}{generated}");  // for parser
```

Two lines of plumbing on top of the mask, but the difference between a
gimmick and a working dispatch path.

### What this looks like in practice

```
$ larql run <vindex> --experts --metal --constrained \
    --ops gcd,is_prime,factorial,to_roman \
    "Is 97 a prime number?"
{"args":{"n":97},"expert_id":"arithmetic","op":"is_prime","value":true}
```

Mistral's free-form answer to the same question, without `--constrained`:
*"Yes, 97 is not a prime number…"* (factually wrong). With
`--constrained`, Mistral's role is reduced to picking `op=is_prime` and
filling in `n=97`. The WASM expert then deterministically returns the
correct answer. Same dynamic for `to_roman(2024)` — Mistral free-forms
"MCMXXIV", but the constrained path picks the op and the WASM expert
returns "MMXXIV".

That's the conceptual payoff of the doc's thesis. With constrained
decode wired, "the model is not being asked to use a tool; it is being
asked to route into a small advertised expert table" stops being a
framing choice and becomes a structural property of the system.

### Why not constrain the args too?

The mask only constrains the op-name field, not the args. Args are left
to free generation because:

  - Argument keys are already advertised in the system prompt
    (`gcd{"a","b"}`), so the model has the right schema in front of it
    when it generates.
  - `parse_op_call` tolerates ragged arg formatting (escaped quotes,
    nested objects, fullwidth punctuation, missing commas before
    `"args":`).
  - True grammar-constrained args would need a JSON Schema decoder
    (per-op schema, type-aware token masking) — a substantial separate
    project.

In practice, the args field works reliably enough across 7B+ instruct
models that the additional engineering hasn't been needed. If a future
model class hallucinates arg *values* (number ranges, string formats)
we'd revisit.

## Test inventory

| Suite                                          | `cargo test` default | With `-- --ignored` |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `larql-inference` lib                          | 873 pass             | 873 pass            |
| `larql-cli` (lib + integration)                | 96 pass, 1 ignored   | 97 pass             |
| `larql-inference --test test_generate_q4k_cpu` | 0 pass, 1 ignored    | 1 pass              |
| **Total**                                      | **969 pass**         | **971 pass**        |

`cargo test` in default config completes in ~3 seconds. The two
`#[ignore]`d tests load a real 4B/7B model and take 30s–7min depending
on backend; explicitly opt-in via `--ignored`.

## What's still loose

- **Args constrained decode.** The op-name field is masked but args are
  free-form. `parse_op_call`'s tolerance + per-op arg keys in the system
  prompt have been enough so far on 7B+ instruct models, but a JSON
  Schema decoder for args is the natural next step if a future model
  class hallucinates arg *values*.
- **The cascade trie probe path** is documented + skip-aware but not
  vendored. CI runs skip; local runs with the probe present exercise the
  full pipeline.
- **Args validation in WASM dispatch.** The `expert_interface` exposes
  the schema but doesn't validate at the WASM boundary — bad args still
  go to the dispatch function and fail there. A schema check in
  `larql_call` would surface earlier with better errors.
- **Multi-turn context.** `ExpertSession` is single-shot per call — it
  doesn't accumulate conversation history. Real chat use cases will need
  a small `ConversationState` wrapper that threads prior op calls into
  the prompt.
- **`Runtime::generate` isn't generic over the dispatcher strategy.**
  So the CLI currently reaches for `Box<dyn Dispatcher>` to swap raw vs.
  filtered. That's the trait being used correctly as a middleware seam,
  which is fine for now — but when a third dispatcher (cached, audited,
  rate-limited) appears, the right move is to push the generic down
  into `Runtime::generate` and drop the box.

## How to use it

```sh
# Build the WASM modules once.
cd crates/larql-experts
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
cd ../..

# Run a focused tool-use session. In practice, always scope ops via --ops —
# even strong models do better with 5–15 options than 126. Add --constrained
# to teacher-force the JSON prefix and mask the op-name field, which
# eliminates the "model decides not to emit JSON" failure mode entirely.
larql run ~/.cache/larql/local/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-q4k.vindex \
    --experts \
    --metal \
    --constrained \
    --ops gcd,is_prime,factorial,to_roman \
    "What is the GCD of 144 and 60?"
```

For chat mode, omit the prompt. For non-Metal CPU decode, omit `--metal`;
it works with any quant, but expect roughly minute-scale responses on 4B
models. `--constrained` works with any backend.
