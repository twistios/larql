# Circuit Type Analysis

Every FFN feature has a gate vector (what activates it) and a down vector (what it produces). The cosine similarity between them classifies the feature's circuit role.

## Circuit types

| Type           | Cosine range | Behaviour                                                 |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identity**   | > 0.5        | Reads X, writes X back (self-reinforcement)               |
| **Transform**  | 0.2 – 0.5    | Reads X, writes a related form (morphological, syntactic) |
| **Projector**  | -0.2 – 0.2   | Reads X, writes something unrelated (factual bridge)      |
| **Suppressor** | -0.5 – -0.2  | Weak direction flip (gating, interference)                |
| **Inverter**   | < -0.5       | Strong direction flip (format enforcement, suppression)   |

### Three phases

**Phase 1: Computation (L7–L18)** — Two activity peaks at L8-9 and L15-16. Transform and suppressor both exceed 20%. This is where the model actively processes inputs — classifying, routing, gating representations.

**Phase 2: Knowledge (L23–L29)** — Projector rises to 85-95%. Minimal active computation. Features bridge between entity and attribute subspaces. L26-27 are the peak knowledge layers (89-90% projector).

**Phase 3: Format gate (L30–L33)** — Identity and inverter spike together. L33 has 5.7% identity + 5.3% inverter = 11% active allow/suppress. Features preserve approved outputs and invert suppressed alternatives.

### L26 — Knowledge bridge peak
88.5% projector. Gate-side queries show clean geographic/semantic clusters (France → Toulouse, París, Italia, €). Features connect entity subspaces to attribute subspaces.

### L33 — Format enforcement
59.6% projector, but 11% identity+inverter — the highest of any layer. Top inverters show character-level suppression (Y→S, sixteen→7). The allow/suppress pair confirms format enforcement from forward pass experiments.

### L33 — Format enforcement
35% active. Highest identity (5.7%) AND inverter (5.3%) of any layer. The allow/suppress pair: identity features preserve approved outputs, inverter features flip suppressed alternatives. Top inverters show character-level suppression (Y→S, sixteen→7, Pherson→M).

## Discovery method

```bash
# Build a vindex
larql extract-index google/gemma-3-4b-it -o output/gemma3-4b.vindex --f16

# Query via REPL
larql repl
> USE "output/gemma3-4b.vindex";
> DESCRIBE "France";
> SHOW FEATURES AT LAYER 26;
```

Or extract raw vectors for analysis:

```bash
larql vector-extract google/gemma-3-4b-it -o output/vectors --resume
python scripts/edge_discover_fast.py --vectors output/vectors --output output/edges --layers 0-33
```

## Key insight

Projector (cosine ≈ 0) is the default — most features at every layer have near-orthogonal gate and down vectors. The model stores input and output directions independently.

The signal is in the **non-projector** features:
- **Identity** features are deliberately preserved directions — what the model chose to keep intact
- **Inverter** features are deliberately flipped — what the model chose to suppress
- **Transform** features are active computation — morphological, syntactic, semantic transforms

The ratio of identity to inverter at each layer reveals the layer's computational role. L33's 5.7% identity + 5.3% inverter = 11% active allow/suppress — the format gate.
