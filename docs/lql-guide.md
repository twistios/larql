# LQL Quick Start Guide

**LQL** (Lazarus Query Language) is the query language for neural network weights treated as a graph database. One binary, no Python, no GPU.

## Launch the REPL

```bash
cargo run -p larql-cli -- repl
```

Features: arrow keys, command history (`~/.larql_history`), Ctrl-R search, Ctrl-C cancel, Ctrl-D exit.

Single statement:

```bash
cargo run -p larql-cli -- lql 'SHOW MODELS;'
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Extract a model

```sql
-- Browse-only (~3 GB f16 / ~6 GB f32, fast queries, no inference)
EXTRACT MODEL "google/gemma-3-4b-it" INTO "gemma3-4b.vindex";

-- With inference support (~6 GB f16 / ~12 GB f32, enables INFER)
EXTRACT MODEL "google/gemma-3-4b-it" INTO "gemma3-4b.vindex" WITH INFERENCE;

-- Full (~10 GB f16 / ~18 GB f32, enables COMPILE for recompilation)
EXTRACT MODEL "google/gemma-3-4b-it" INTO "gemma3-4b.vindex" WITH ALL;
```

CLI equivalent: `larql extract-index google/gemma-3-4b-it -o gemma3-4b.vindex --level inference --f16`

### 2. Connect

```sql
-- Use a pre-extracted vindex (fast, all operations)
USE "gemma3-4b.vindex";
STATS;

-- Or point directly at model weights (no extraction needed)
USE MODEL "google/gemma-3-4b-it";
STATS;
-- Supports: INFER, EXPLAIN INFER, STATS
-- For WALK/DESCRIBE/SELECT/INSERT: extract into a vindex first
```

### 3. Browse knowledge

```sql
-- What does the model know about France?
-- Verbose by default: relation labels, also-tokens, layer ranges
DESCRIBE "France";

-- Compact view: top edges, primary layer only
DESCRIBE "France" BRIEF;

-- No labels — pure model signal
DESCRIBE "France" RAW;

-- Show all layer bands (syntax + knowledge + output)
DESCRIBE "France" ALL LAYERS;

-- Single layer
DESCRIBE "Mozart" AT LAYER 26;

-- Feature scan: which features fire for a prompt?
WALK "The capital of France is" TOP 10;

-- Per-layer trace
EXPLAIN WALK "The capital of France is" LAYERS 24-33;

-- SQL-style edge queries
SELECT entity, target FROM EDGES WHERE relation = "capital" LIMIT 10;

-- Synonym-robust relation filter (FR3): if "seat" matches no stored relation
-- exactly, it is resolved to a known relation by meaning ("seat" → capital,
-- "money" → currency) via a trained residual probe, then re-run against the
-- canonical relation. Needs a vindex with model weights + relation labels.
SELECT * FROM EDGES WHERE relation = "seat" LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Run inference

Requires model weights: either a vindex built with `WITH INFERENCE` / `WITH ALL`,
or a `USE MODEL` session (direct weight access).

```sql
-- Next-token prediction with attention
INFER "The capital of France is" TOP 5;

-- Compare walk (no attention) vs infer (with attention)
INFER "The capital of France is" TOP 5 COMPARE;

-- Full inference trace
EXPLAIN INFER "The capital of France is" TOP 5;
```

For facts installed with `INSERT … MODE KNN`, the `ROUTE` clause selects how the
KNN side-channel decides whether to override the model's answer:

```sql
-- FR1 verified router: among the top-k activation candidates, override only
-- with a fact whose entity the prompt actually names — otherwise abstain and
-- let the model answer. Fixes the legacy "confident-wrong" injection. The safe
-- default for open queries. TOPK sets the candidate pool (default 5).
INFER "The capital of Atlantis is" ROUTE VERIFY TOP 3;

-- FR2 two-tier router: VERIFY first, then an activation-alias fallback for when
-- the prompt names an alias rather than the stored entity (e.g. "Persia" → Iran).
-- WARNING: the fallback has no entity-name guard, so on a query about a
-- non-stored entity it can confident-wrong like the legacy gate — use FALLBACK
-- only for queries known to be aliases of stored entities.
INFER "The capital of Persia is" ROUTE VERIFY FALLBACK TOPK 8 TOP 3;

-- EXIT: retrieval-augmented early exit. When the verified hit fires, the forward
-- short-circuits at the resolved layer — the stored target is emitted and the
-- remaining layers + lm_head are skipped (parity-exact, ~1.4× faster on
-- fact-lookup answer tokens). Verified-only; ignored with FALLBACK.
INFER "The capital of Atlantis is" ROUTE VERIFY EXIT TOP 3;
```

With no `ROUTE` clause, INFER inherits the global default from the `LARQL_KNN_*`
env vars (`LARQL_KNN_VERIFY` → verified, `+ LARQL_KNN_FALLBACK` → two-tier;
`LARQL_KNN_TOPK`, `LARQL_KNN_MIN_COS` tune the knobs). Unset → legacy top-1 gate.

### 5. Edit knowledge

```sql
-- Insert a fact (default KNN retrieval override)
INSERT INTO EDGES (entity, relation, target)
    VALUES ("John Coyle", "lives-in", "Colchester");

-- Insert with all COMPOSE knobs: choose the layer, set confidence,
-- and dial the down-vector override strength
INSERT INTO EDGES (entity, relation, target)
    VALUES ("Atlantis", "capital-of", "Poseidon")
    AT LAYER 24
    CONFIDENCE 0.95
    ALPHA 0.30
    MODE COMPOSE;

-- Verify
DESCRIBE "John Coyle";

-- Delete
DELETE FROM EDGES WHERE entity = "John Coyle" AND relation = "lives-in";

-- Update by entity (works on both heap and mmap-loaded vindexes)
UPDATE EDGES SET target = "London"
    WHERE entity = "John Coyle" AND relation = "lives-in";

-- Update by (layer, feature) — fast-path, bypasses the entity scan
UPDATE EDGES SET target = "London", confidence = 0.95
    WHERE layer = 26 AND feature = 8821;
```

INSERT defaults to `MODE KNN`, which records a retrieval override and ignores
`ALPHA`. Use `MODE COMPOSE` when you want an FFN overlay that participates in
inference and can be compiled into vindex/model bytes; its default `ALPHA` is
0.10, with the validated range around 0.05-0.30. Relation predicates on
DELETE/UPDATE require relation labels in the active vindex; otherwise target
by `(layer, feature)` or omit `relation`.

### 6. Patches

Patches are lightweight knowledge diffs — portable JSON files that modify a vindex without touching the base files.

```sql
-- Start recording a patch
BEGIN PATCH "medical-knowledge.vlp";

INSERT INTO EDGES (entity, relation, target)
    VALUES ("aspirin", "side_effect", "bleeding");
INSERT INTO EDGES (entity, relation, target)
    VALUES ("aspirin", "treats", "headache");

-- Save (base vindex NOT modified)
SAVE PATCH;

-- Apply a patch
APPLY PATCH "medical-knowledge.vlp";

-- Stack multiple patches
APPLY PATCH "fix-hallucinations.vlp";

-- See active patches
SHOW PATCHES;

-- Remove a patch (instantly reverts)
REMOVE PATCH "fix-hallucinations.vlp";

-- Extract diff as a patch
DIFF "base.vindex" "edited.vindex" INTO PATCH "changes.vlp";
```

### 7. Recompile

```sql
-- See what changed
DIFF "gemma3-4b.vindex" CURRENT;

-- Bake the patches into a fresh standalone vindex (instant on APFS:
-- weight files hardlinked from source, only down_weights.bin gets the
-- override columns rewritten in place).
COMPILE CURRENT INTO VINDEX "gemma3-4b-medical.vindex";

-- Use the compiled vindex like any other — INFER produces the new
-- facts with no patch overlay loaded.
USE "gemma3-4b-medical.vindex";
INFER "The capital of Atlantis is" TOP 5;

-- Or compile back to HuggingFace format. The constellation is in the
-- standard down_proj tensors, so loading in Transformers / GGUF
-- runtimes Just Works.
COMPILE CURRENT INTO MODEL "gemma3-4b-edited/" FORMAT safetensors;
```

## Residual Stream Trace

Trace decomposes a forward pass into attention and FFN contributions at every layer.

```sql
-- What does the model predict at each layer?
TRACE "The capital of France is";

-- Track a specific answer through all layers
TRACE "The capital of France is" FOR "Paris";
-- Shows rank, probability, attn/FFN logit contribution, who pushes the answer

-- Attention vs FFN decomposition at the phase transition
TRACE "The capital of France is" DECOMPOSE LAYERS 22-27;

-- Save the trace to an mmap'd file
TRACE "The capital of France is" SAVE "france.trace";

-- Trace all token positions (not just last)
TRACE "The capital of France is" POSITIONS ALL SAVE "france_all.trace";
```

TRACE requires model weights (`WITH ALL` or `WITH INFERENCE` during EXTRACT). It uses the same WalkFfn as INFER — INSERT/DELETE mutations are reflected.

## Introspection

```sql
-- Discovered relation types
SHOW RELATIONS WITH EXAMPLES;

-- Layer summary
SHOW LAYERS;
SHOW LAYERS RANGE 14-27;

-- Feature details
SHOW FEATURES 26 LIMIT 20;

-- Available vindexes in current directory
SHOW MODELS;

-- Active patches
SHOW PATCHES;

-- Knowledge graph coverage
STATS;
```

## Layer Bands

DESCRIBE groups features into three bands based on the model's layer structure:

| Band      | Gemma 3 4B | Llama 3 8B | What it contains                 |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Syntax    | L0-13      | L0-12      | Morphological, syntactic, code   |
| Knowledge | L14-27     | L13-25     | Factual relations (default view) |
| Output    | L28-33     | L26-31     | Formatting, token selection      |

```sql
DESCRIBE "France";              -- Verbose: relation labels, also-tokens, layer ranges (default)
DESCRIBE "France" BRIEF;        -- Compact: top edges, primary layer only
DESCRIBE "France" RAW;          -- No labels, pure model signal
DESCRIBE "France" SYNTAX;       -- Syntax band only
DESCRIBE "France" OUTPUT;       -- Output band only
DESCRIBE "France" ALL LAYERS;   -- All three bands
```

Bands are model-specific — computed automatically during EXTRACT from known architecture boundaries.
