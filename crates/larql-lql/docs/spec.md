# LQL — Lazarus Query Language Specification

**Version:** 0.4  
**Date:** 2026-04-11  
**Status:** Draft  
**Implementation target:** `larql-lql` crate (Rust)  
**Companion:** `larql-knowledge` spec (data pipeline)

---

## 1. Design Principles

LQL is a query language for neural network weights treated as a graph database. It is not SQL. It is not SPARQL. It borrows from both but serves a different purpose: decompiling, inspecting, editing, and recompiling neural networks

**Principles:**

1. **Weights are rows.** Every W_gate row is a record. Every W_down column is a record. Every embedding vector is a record. The model IS the database.
2. **Two backends, one language.** LQL operates on either a `.vindex` (pre-extracted, fast) or directly on model weights via safetensors (live, no extraction needed). The vindex is preferred for production — sub-millisecond lookups from a pre-built index. Direct weight access is for exploration — point at any model, start querying immediately. Same statements, same results, different performance.
3. **Statements, not scripts.** Each LQL statement is self-contained. No variables that persist across statements (except `USE` context). Pipe results with `|>`.
4. **Three verbs for the demo.** The video needs exactly: `EXTRACT`, `DESCRIBE`, `INSERT`, `COMPILE`. Everything else is power-user.
5. **Rust-native.** The parser lives in `larql-lql`. No Python dependency. No runtime. One binary.
6. **Labels are external.** Relation labels come from the `larql-knowledge` project (probes, Wikidata triples, WordNet, AST pairs). The engine reads label files. It does not contain ingestion or probing code.

## 3. Grammar

### 3.1 Notation

```
UPPERCASE  = keyword (case-insensitive in parser)
<name>     = required parameter
[name]     = optional parameter
{a | b}    = choice
...        = repeatable
```

### 3.2 Model Lifecycle Statements

```
EXTRACT MODEL <model_id> INTO <vindex_path>
    [COMPONENTS <component_list>]
    [LAYERS <range>]
    [WITH {INFERENCE | ALL}]

-- Decompile a HuggingFace model (or local path) into a vindex.
-- 
-- Default (no WITH clause): builds the browse-only vindex.
--   Extracts: gate_vectors, embeddings, down_meta, labels
--   Enables: WALK, DESCRIBE, SELECT, EXPLAIN WALK
--   Size: ~3 GB (f16)
--
-- WITH INFERENCE: adds attention weights for INFER.
--   Adds: attn_weights (Q, K, V, O per layer)
--   Enables: + INFER, EXPLAIN INFER
--   Size: ~6 GB (f16)
--
-- WITH ALL: adds all weights for COMPILE.
--   Adds: + up_weights, norms, lm_head
--   Enables: + COMPILE
--   Size: ~10 GB (f16)
--
-- Layers: 0-33 (default: all)
-- No data is duplicated — gate_vectors IS W_gate, embeddings IS W_embed.

EXTRACT MODEL "google/gemma-3-4b-it"
    INTO "gemma3-4b.vindex";
-- Browse-only: ~3 GB

EXTRACT MODEL "google/gemma-3-4b-it"
    INTO "gemma3-4b.vindex"
    WITH INFERENCE;
-- Browse + inference: ~6 GB

EXTRACT MODEL "google/gemma-3-4b-it"
    INTO "gemma3-4b.vindex"
    WITH ALL;
-- Full: ~10 GB, supports COMPILE
```

```
COMPILE {<vindex_path> | CURRENT} INTO MODEL <output_path>
    [FORMAT {safetensors | gguf}]

-- Recompile a vindex back to model weights.
-- Round-trip: EXTRACT then COMPILE should produce identical weights.
--
-- INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE mutations applied to the vindex are baked into
-- the canonical down_weights.bin (column-rewrite at the inserted slots),
-- so the exported safetensors / gguf file already contains the
-- constellation in the standard down_proj tensors. No special loader
-- support is needed — load the output in HuggingFace Transformers, GGUF
-- runtimes, etc. and the inserted facts fire through the standard FFN.

COMPILE CURRENT
    INTO MODEL "gemma3-4b-edited/"
    FORMAT safetensors;
```

```
DIFF <vindex_a> {<vindex_b> | CURRENT}
    [LAYER <n>]
    [RELATION <type>]
    [LIMIT <n>]

-- Show edges that differ between two vindexes.

DIFF "gemma3-4b.vindex" CURRENT;

DIFF "gemma3-4b.vindex" "gemma3-4b-edited.vindex"
    RELATION "capital"
    LIMIT 20;
```

```
USE <vindex_path>;
USE MODEL <model_id> [AUTO_EXTRACT];
USE REMOTE <url>;

-- Set the active backend for subsequent statements.
-- USE with a .vindex path: fast, pre-extracted, all statements available.
-- USE MODEL: live weight access, reads safetensors directly. Slower but
--   zero setup — point at any model, start querying immediately.
-- USE REMOTE: HTTP client to a `larql serve` instance. All read queries
--   are forwarded over the wire. Mutations create a local patch overlay
--   (the remote vindex is not modified).
-- AUTO_EXTRACT: create vindex automatically on first mutation.
--
-- Mutation (INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE) and COMPILE require a vindex.
-- INFER requires model weights (either via --include-weights or USE MODEL).

    [MODE {hybrid | pure | dense}]
    [COMPARE]

-- Feature scan: what gate features fire for the last token's embedding.
-- This is a knowledge browser operation, NOT inference.
-- No attention is used. The query is the raw token embedding.
-- Returns per-layer top features with relation labels and gate scores.

WALK "France" TOP 10;

    TOP 10
    LAYERS 24-33;
```

```
DESCRIBE <entity>
    [{ALL LAYERS | SYNTAX | KNOWLEDGE | OUTPUT}]
    [AT LAYER <n>]
    [RELATIONS ONLY]
    [{VERBOSE | BRIEF | RAW}]

-- Show all knowledge for an entity. Groups by layer band:
--   SYNTAX:     morphological, syntactic, code structure features
--   KNOWLEDGE:  semantic/factual features (default view)
--   OUTPUT:     formatting/output features
--   ALL LAYERS: show all three bands
--
-- Display modes:
--   BRIEF (default): compact view — top edges only, primary layer, no also-tokens.
--   VERBOSE: relation labels in [brackets], also-tokens,
--            layer ranges, multi-layer hit counts.
--            Labelled features show [relation], unlabelled show [—].
--   RAW:     no probe/cluster labels — pure model signal with also-tokens.
--
-- Layer band boundaries are model-specific, stored in index.json:
--   Gemma 3 4B:  syntax=0-13, knowledge=14-27, output=28-33
--   Llama 3 8B:  syntax=0-15, knowledge=16-28, output=29-31
--   (boundaries discoverable via SHOW LAYERS)
--
-- Labels come from multiple sources (highest priority first):
--   1. Probe-confirmed (model inference verified this feature)
--   2. Wikidata output matching (L14-27 only)
--   3. WordNet output matching (L0-13 only)
--   4. AST output matching (L0-13 only)
--   5. Entity pattern detection (country, language, month, number)
--   6. Morphological detection (short suffixes/prefixes)
--   7. TF-IDF top tokens (fallback)
--
-- Each edge shows: relation label, target token, gate score,
-- layer range, occurrence count, and "also:" variant tokens.

### 3.4 Inference Statements

```
INFER <prompt>
    [ROUTE VERIFY [FALLBACK] [TOPK <n>] [EXIT]]
    [TOP <n>]
    [COMPARE]

-- Full forward pass with attention. Requires attention weights.
-- Vindex must be built with WITH INFERENCE or WITH ALL.
-- Or use USE MODEL for live weight access.
-- Uses walk FFN (gate KNN from vindex) as the FFN backend,
-- but runs real attention for token routing.
-- COMPARE: also run dense inference and show both.
--
-- ROUTE selects the KnnStore router (FR1/FR2) for INSERT … MODE KNN facts.
-- Default (no clause): legacy top-1 + fixed 0.75 cosine gate — fires on
--   near-rank-1 collisions and can inject a confident-wrong fact.
-- ROUTE VERIFY (FR1): top-k candidates + a verifier that only overrides with a
--   fact whose entity the PROMPT names, else abstains. Fixes confident-wrong.
--   TOPK <n> sets the candidate count (default 5).
-- ROUTE VERIFY FALLBACK (FR2): adds an activation alias fallback — if no
--   candidate's entity is named (alias/paraphrase, e.g. "Persia"→Iran), route
--   by the top-1 activation key. Recovers aliases exact-string can't, at a
--   fuzzy ~0.7-0.9 rate. WARNING: the fallback has no entity-name guard, so on
--   an open query about a NON-stored entity it confident-wrongs like the legacy
--   gate (measured 0/20 distractor-safe vs VERIFY's 20/20). Use FALLBACK only
--   for queries known to be aliases of stored entities; VERIFY is the safe
--   open default.
-- ROUTE VERIFY EXIT: retrieval-augmented EARLY EXIT. When the verified router
--   fires, the forward short-circuits at the resolved layer (~0.7 depth) — the
--   stored target is emitted and the remaining layers + lm_head are SKIPPED.
--   Parity-exact (the emitted token is byte-identical to the full forward) and
--   ~1.4× faster on fact-lookup answer tokens. Verified-only: EXIT is ignored
--   when FALLBACK is set (the FR2 fallback needs the full forward to stay
--   parity-identical). On a verify-miss the forward completes normally.
-- (The LARQL_KNN_VERIFY / LARQL_KNN_FALLBACK / LARQL_KNN_TOPK / LARQL_KNN_MIN_COS
--  env vars set the default when no ROUTE clause is present;
--  LARQL_KNN_EARLY_EXIT turns on EXIT for the env-default verified path.)

### 3.5 Knowledge Mutation Statements

```
INSERT INTO EDGES
    (entity, relation, target)
    VALUES (<entity>, <relation>, <target>)
    [AT LAYER <n>]
    [CONFIDENCE <float>]
    [ALPHA <float>]
    [MODE {KNN | COMPOSE}]

-- Add an edge to the vindex.
-- The relation should be one of the known types (from probe/cluster labels).
--
-- INSERT has two install modes. Default: KNN.
--
-- MODE KNN (default) — Architecture B retrieval override:
--   Captures the model's residual at the install layer (or the entity
--   embedding if no weights are available) and stores it as a key in
--   the per-layer KnnStore alongside the target token. INFER overrides
--   the model's top-1 when a stored key matches the inference residual
--   at cos > 0.75. Scales freely (validated at 25K edges, 87 edges/s,
--   100% same-prompt retrieval) — independent entries, no cross-fact
--   interference. Doesn't participate in the forward pass.
--
-- MODE COMPOSE — FFN-overlay install:
--   Writes a single-layer slot via the install_compiled_slot pipeline
--   (gate_scale=30, up = gate_dir × u_ref, down = target_embed_unit ×
--   d_ref × alpha). Features participate in the forward pass and can
--   chain for multi-hop. Has a Hopfield-style cap at ~5–10 facts per
--   layer under template-shared prompts — run REBALANCE after a batch
--   install to fixed-point the down magnitudes. Validated 10/10
--   retrieval, 0/4 regression bleed on Gemma 3 4B (exp 14).
--
-- AT LAYER N: pins the install to a single layer. Default:
--   `knowledge.hi − 1` (L26 on Gemma 4B). Single-layer only —
--   earlier drafts used an 8-layer span but the install_compiled_slot
--   (×30 gate) math makes multi-layer spans hijack unrelated prompts.
-- CONFIDENCE: stored on the inserted features (default: 0.9 for
--   COMPOSE, 1.0 for KNN).
-- ALPHA:      COMPOSE only — per-layer down-vector scale (default:
--   0.10). Validated range ~0.05–0.30 in the Python reference.
--   Larger values push the new fact harder but dilute neighbouring
--   facts; smaller values reduce neighbour degradation.
-- MODE:       KNN (default) or COMPOSE.

-- [FLOOR, CEILING] band. Per-INSERT local balance is greedy and
-- breaks past N ≈ 5 on template-shared prompts; this pass converges
-- the full batch jointly.
--
-- Defaults: MAX 16, FLOOR 0.30, CEILING 0.90.
-- UNTIL CONVERGED is accepted but redundant (the loop always runs
-- until convergence or MAX iters).
-- KNN installs don't need rebalancing.

-- every other weight file is hard-linked from the source (instant, free
-- on APFS — same inode, same bytes).
--
-- INSERT handles bleed defense at install time (batch refine against
-- cached decoy residuals), so no compile-time refine step is needed.
--
-- ON CONFLICT controls how to resolve (layer, feature) slots that are
-- written by more than one applied patch:
--   LAST_WINS (default):  the last applied patch wins.
--   HIGHEST_CONFIDENCE:   accepted for forward compatibility but currently
--                         resolves like LAST_WINS for down vectors —
--                         see implementation note below.
--   FAIL:                 abort if any slot has a conflicting write.
-- ON CONFLICT is only valid for COMPILE INTO VINDEX, not COMPILE INTO MODEL.
--
-- A subsequent USE on the compiled vindex needs no special loader code:
-- it loads like any other vindex and INFER produces the inserted facts
-- through the standard dense FFN path. From this point you can also run
-- COMPILE INTO MODEL to export to safetensors / gguf — the constellation
-- is already in the bytes that get exported.

COMPILE CURRENT INTO VINDEX "gemma3-4b-medical.vindex";

COMPILE CURRENT INTO VINDEX "gemma3-4b-medical.vindex"
    ON CONFLICT FAIL;
```

```
COMPILE {CURRENT | <vindex_path>} INTO MODEL <output_path> [FORMAT safetensors|gguf]

-- Compile the current vindex (with patches) or a path-loaded vindex into
-- plain model weights.
-- If the patch overlay contains INSERT operations, MEMIT closed-form
-- weight editing is used to bake the inserted facts into W_down at the
-- install layer(s). The output is a standard safetensors / gguf file
-- with no vindex dependency at inference time.
--
-- Requires model weights in the vindex (EXTRACT ... WITH ALL).

COMPILE CURRENT INTO MODEL "gemma3-4b-edited/" FORMAT safetensors;
```

> **Implementation note (HIGHEST_CONFIDENCE).** Down vectors are
> synthesised at INSERT time and stored on the base index in
> last-wins-collapsed form, so re-resolving them from raw patches at
> compile time would require regenerating the synthesised vectors.
> The compile path currently keeps last-wins semantics for down vectors
> regardless of the strategy chosen, but FAIL fully detects collisions
> and HIGHEST_CONFIDENCE is accepted for forward compatibility.

### 3.6 Schema Introspection Statements

```
SHOW RELATIONS
    [AT LAYER <n>]
    [WITH EXAMPLES]
    [{VERBOSE | BRIEF | RAW}]

-- Display modes:
--   BRIEF (default): probe-confirmed relations only.
--   VERBOSE: probe-confirmed relations + raw output tokens with scores/layers.
--   RAW:     raw output tokens only, no probe labels.

SHOW LAYERS
    [RANGE <start>-<end>]
    [{<start>-<end>}]

SHOW FEATURES <layer>
    [WHERE <conditions>]
    [LIMIT <n>]

SHOW ENTITIES
    [AT LAYER <n> | <n>]
    [LIMIT <n>]

-- Scan the loaded layers for distinct named-entity-shaped tokens
-- (uppercase start, alphabetic, length ≥ 3, not a stop word) and
-- report them sorted by feature count. Works on browse-only vindexes
-- — no model weights needed.

SHOW MODELS;

SHOW PATCHES;

SHOW COMPACT STATUS;

-- Report the storage engine's current tier occupancy (L0 WAL/KNN,
-- L1 arch-A compose, L2 MEMIT) and the session epoch. L2 is only
-- reported when hidden_dim ≥ 1024 (MEMIT requirement).

STATS [<vindex_path>];
```

`COMPACT MINOR` and `COMPACT MAJOR` are the two tier-promotion verbs —
they live alongside `REBALANCE` in the mutation family (§3.5) but
read like introspection from the user's perspective:

```
COMPACT MINOR;
-- Promote every L0 (KNN) entry into L1 (arch-A compose edges).
-- Uses exec_insert internally with MODE COMPOSE; requires model
-- weights. A no-op when L0 is empty.

COMPACT MAJOR [FULL] [WITH LAMBDA = <float>];
-- Promote L1 compose edges to L2 MEMIT-decomposed (key, down) pairs.
-- FULL re-decomposes every L1 edge; default does only the ones the
-- current compose overlay owns. LAMBDA is the MEMIT ridge (default
-- 1e-3).
```

### 3.7 Residual Stream Trace Statements

```
TRACE <prompt>
    [FOR <token>]
    [DECOMPOSE]
    [LAYERS <start>-<end>]
    [POSITIONS {LAST | ALL}]
    [SAVE <path>]

-- Capture a residual stream trace through the forward pass.
-- Decomposes each layer into attn_delta + ffn_delta against the residual.
-- Requires model weights in the vindex (WITH INFERENCE or WITH ALL).
--
-- FOR <token>:    track this target token's rank, probability, and the
--                 attn/FFN logit contributions per layer.
-- DECOMPOSE:      print the per-layer attn vs FFN attribution table.
-- LAYERS s-e:     restrict the trace to the inclusive layer range.
-- POSITIONS LAST: trace only the last token (default).
-- POSITIONS ALL:  trace every token position in the prompt.
-- SAVE <path>:    write the captured trace to a file.

TRACE "The capital of France is";
-- Default trace, last token only

TRACE "The capital of France is" FOR "Paris";
-- Layer  Rank   Prob    Attn      FFN
-- L22     50   0.002   +22.2    +34.4   BOTH ↑
-- L23     10   0.024   -16.9    +55.9   FFN ↑
-- L24      1   0.714  +105.7    +24.4   BOTH ↑   ← phase transition
-- L25      1   0.997    +4.3    +94.4   FFN ↑

TRACE "The capital of France is"
    DECOMPOSE
    LAYERS 22-27;
-- Per-layer attn vs FFN delta table

TRACE "The capital of France is"
    POSITIONS ALL
    SAVE "france.trace";
-- All token positions, all layers, written to file
```

> Planned: `TRACE ... DIFF <prompt_b>` (cross-prompt comparison),
> tiered SAVE formats (`FORMAT boundary | context`, `TIER`, `WINDOW`),
> and `BOUNDARY OPEN` / `BOUNDARY <path> AT <n>` boundary stores.
> See §11. The wire format and capture machinery already exist in

### 3.8 Comparison Operators

```
=    -- equal
!=   -- not equal
>    -- greater than
<    -- less than
>=   -- greater than or equal
<=   -- less than or equal
LIKE -- pattern match (% wildcard)
IN   -- set membership

WHERE entity = "France"
WHERE confidence > 0.5
WHERE entity LIKE "Fran%"
WHERE entity IN ("France", "Germany")
WHERE layer >= 20 AND layer <= 30
```

## 4. Backend Architecture

LQL abstracts over two backends through a common trait. Every query statement works against either backend.

### 4.1 The Two Backends

### 4.3 Promotion: Weights → Vindex

Direct weight access is the on-ramp. When someone hits a mutation, LQL nudges:

```
larql> USE MODEL "google/gemma-3-4b-it";
Using model: google/gemma-3-4b-it (8.1 GB, live weights)

larql> INSERT INTO EDGES (entity, relation, target)
   ...   VALUES ("John Coyle", "lives-in", "Colchester");
Error: INSERT requires a vindex. Run:
  EXTRACT MODEL "google/gemma-3-4b-it" INTO "gemma3-4b.vindex";
  USE "gemma3-4b.vindex";
```

---

## 5. Label Architecture

Feature labels come from the `larql-knowledge` project and are stored in the vindex as JSON files. The engine reads them; it does not produce them.

### 5.1 Label Sources (Priority Order)

| Priority | Source                   | Confidence | Layer Band | Description                                                          |
|----------|--------------------------|------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Probe-confirmed          | Highest    | Knowledge  | Model inference confirmed this feature encodes this relation         |
| 2        | Wikidata output matching | High       | Knowledge  | Cluster outputs match Wikidata objects                               |
| 3        | WordNet output matching  | High       | Syntax     | Cluster outputs match WordNet pairs                                  |
| 4        | AST output matching      | High       | Syntax     | Cluster outputs match code AST pairs                                 |
| 5        | Entity pattern detection | Medium     | Any        | Cluster members match known lists (country, language, month, number) |
| 6        | Morphological detection  | Medium     | Syntax     | Cluster members are short suffixes/prefixes                          |
| 7        | TF-IDF top tokens        | Low        | Any        | Fallback: most distinctive tokens in the cluster                     |

### 5.2 Vindex File Layout

The vindex IS the model, reorganised for queryability. No data is duplicated — each weight matrix is stored once in its optimal format.

```
gemma3-4b.vindex/

  # ═══ Query Index (the vindex core) ═══
  # These are the model's FFN + embedding weights in a queryable format.
  # WALK, DESCRIBE, SELECT, EXPLAIN WALK use only these files.
  
  gate_vectors.bin            # W_gate rows per layer (KNN index)
                              # ~3.3 GB (f32) or ~1.7 GB (f16)
  
  embeddings.bin              # W_embed matrix (token lookup)
                              # ~2.5 GB (f32) or ~1.3 GB (f16)
  
  down_meta.bin               # W_down decoded: per-feature top token IDs + scores
                              # ~2 MB (binary) — replaces 160 MB JSONL
  
  # ═══ Inference Weights (for INFER, not duplicated) ═══
  # Only the weights NOT already in the query index.
  # INFER loads these in addition to the query index.
  
  attn_weights.bin            # Q, K, V, O attention matrices per layer
                              # ~3 GB (f16)
  
  # ═══ Compile Weights (for COMPILE, not duplicated) ═══
  # Additional weights needed to reconstruct full safetensors.
  
  up_weights.bin              # W_up per layer
                              # ~3.3 GB (f16)
  
  norms.bin                   # LayerNorm parameters per layer
                              # ~1 MB
  
  lm_head.bin                 # Output projection (unembed)
                              # ~1.3 GB (f16) — or shared with embeddings if tied
  
  # ═══ Metadata & Labels ═══
  
  index.json                  # Config: layers, hidden_size, vocab_size,
                              # component manifest, build info
  tokenizer.json              # Tokenizer (~32 MB)
  relation_clusters.json      # Cluster centres, labels, counts
  feature_clusters.jsonl      # Per-feature cluster assignments
  feature_labels.json         # Probe-confirmed labels (from larql-knowledge)
```

**Size by use case:**

| Use Case                             | Files Loaded                      | Size (f16) | Size (f32 current) |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|--------------------|
| Browse only (WALK, DESCRIBE, SELECT) | gate + embed + down_meta + labels | ~3 GB      | ~6 GB              |
| Browse + Inference (+ INFER)         | Above + attn_weights              | ~6 GB      | ~9 GB              |
| Full (+ COMPILE)                     | All files                         | ~10 GB     | ~16 GB             |

**Compared to original model:**

```
Original HuggingFace model (f16):    ~8 GB
Vindex browse-only (f16):            ~3 GB  (62% smaller)
Vindex browse + infer (f16):         ~6 GB  (25% smaller)
Vindex full (f16):                   ~10 GB (25% larger, but queryable + compilable)
```

Each component loads lazily — DESCRIBE never touches attention weights, INFER never touches up_weights. The vindex grows from 3GB to 10GB as you need more capabilities, but the browse-only core is always small.

**Deduplication principle:** gate_vectors.bin IS W_gate. embeddings.bin IS W_embed. They are not copies — they are the canonical storage. COMPILE reads gate_vectors.bin to reconstruct W_gate in safetensors format. No data is stored twice.

### 5.3 Layer-Aware Matching

| Layer Band                | Name                      | Reference Databases                                        | Typical Relations                                         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Syntax (early layers)     | Morphological + Syntactic | Morphological lexicon, WordNet, English grammar, AST pairs | plural, gerund, synonym, determiner→noun, py:function_def |
| Knowledge (middle layers) | Factual + Relational      | Wikidata triples, probe labels                             | capital, language, continent, occupation, genre           |
| Output (late layers)      | Formatting                | None (formatting)                                          | TF-IDF fallback only                                      |

Layer band boundaries are model-specific and stored in `index.json`:

```json
{
  "layer_bands": {
    "syntax": [0, 13],
    "knowledge": [14, 27],
    "output": [28, 33]
  }
}
```

Default boundaries are computed during EXTRACT by analysing feature distributions. Models with more layers have wider bands. The boundaries can be overridden manually.

**Example boundaries by model:**

| Model       | Layers | Syntax | Knowledge | Output |
|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Gemma 3 4B  | 34     | 0-13   | 14-27     | 28-33  |
| Llama 3 8B  | 32     | 0-12   | 13-25     | 26-31  |
| Llama 3 70B | 80     | 0-30   | 31-65     | 66-79  |
| Mistral 7B  | 32     | 0-12   | 13-25     | 26-31  |
| GPT-2       | 12     | 0-4    | 5-9       | 10-11  |

These are estimates. The actual boundaries are discoverable via `SHOW LAYERS` — the layer where factual features start appearing marks the syntax/knowledge boundary.

### 5.4 DESCRIBE Output Format

**Brief (default):** compact, top edges only.

```
larql> DESCRIBE "France";
France
  Edges (L14-27):
                 → Paris                    9.2  L27
                 → français                14.7  L23
                 → Europe                  14.4  L25
```

**Verbose:** relation labels in brackets, also-tokens, layer ranges.

```
larql> DESCRIBE "France" VERBOSE;
France
  Edges (L14-27):
    [capital]      → Paris                    9.2  L27      1x  also: Francia, París
    [language]     → français                14.7  L23      1x  also: French, oiseaux
    [continent]    → Europe                  14.4  L10-25   4x  also: Belgique, Lesotho
    [—]            → Spain                   13.3  L18      1x  also: España, Germany
    [—]            → Senegal                  9.4  L16      1x  also: Algeria, Moroccan
    [—]            → Channel                  7.2  L26      1x  also: channels, Channels
  Output (L28-33):
    [—]            → French                  35.2  L15-32   8x  also: Conseil
    [—]            → European                11.9  L11-33   7x  also: EUROPE, Euro, German
```

Labelled features show `[relation]` (from probe or cluster). Unlabelled features show `[—]` — model-discovered associations the probes didn't cover. The `also:` column shows what cluster each feature belongs to.

**Raw:** no labels, pure model signal.

```
larql> DESCRIBE "France" RAW;
France
  Edges (L14-27):
                 → Paris                    9.2  L27      1x  also: Francia, París
                 → français                14.7  L23      1x  also: French, oiseaux
                 → Europe                  14.4  L10-25   4x  also: Belgique, Lesotho
```

## 6. Pipe Operator

LQL supports `|>` to chain statements. The output of the left statement becomes context for the right.

```sql
WALK "The capital of France is" TOP 5
    |> EXPLAIN WALK "The capital of France is";

DESCRIBE "France"
    |> DIFF WITH "llama3-8b.vindex";
```

## 8. Implementation Notes

### 8.1 Parser Architecture

```
Input string
    → Lexer (tokenise keywords, strings, numbers, operators)
    → Parser (recursive descent, one statement at a time)
    → AST (Statement enum with variants per statement type)
    → Executor (dispatches to larql-core / larql-inference / larql-models)
```

The parser and executor live in `larql-lql`, organized as modular
subfiles. Each LQL verb gets its own file; orchestrator modules are
kept tight so the top-down flow reads clearly.

```

### 8.2 AST

Canonical definition lives in `crates/larql-lql/src/ast.rs`. The shape
below is kept in sync with the real enum — if they diverge, the source
file wins.

> **Note.** `Rebalance`, `ShowEntities`, `ShowCompactStatus`,
> `CompactMinor`, `CompactMajor`, the full patch family, `Trace`, and
> `UseTarget::Remote` were added after the first-cut AST; `InsertMode`,
> `alpha` on `Insert`, `on_conflict` on `Compile`, `into_patch` on
> `Diff`, and `SelectSource` on `Select` are likewise additions. Any
> earlier external doc that lists a smaller enum is stale.

### 8.5 INSERT Semantics — How Edge Becomes Vector

When you `INSERT ("John Coyle", "lives-in", "Colchester")`:

1. **Find the relation direction.** Look up the "lives-in" cluster centre from schema discovery. The probe labels provide the geometric direction for known relations.
2. **Find the entity embedding.** Look up "John" and "Coyle" token embeddings. Combine to get the entity vector.
3. **Find the target embedding.** Look up "Colchester" token embedding.
4. **Synthesise the gate vector.** Gate direction ≈ entity embedding, scaled to match existing gate magnitudes at the target layer.
5. **Synthesise the down vector.** Down direction ≈ target embedding, scaled to match existing down magnitudes.
6. **Synthesise the up vector.** Up direction ≈ gate direction (for simple facts).
7. **Find a free feature slot.** Use an unused feature (low activation across all entities).
8. **Write the vectors.** Update gate_vectors.bin, down metadata, and up vectors in the vindex.

The relation type determines which layer to write to. Probe data shows which layers each relation type occupies (e.g., capital features cluster at L24-27, language features at L22-32).

## 10. Integration with larql-knowledge

The `larql-knowledge` project produces all label artifacts. The engine consumes them.

### 10.1 Label Merge Command

```bash
# After running probes in larql-knowledge:
larql label <vindex_path> \
  --probes <path_to_feature_labels.json> \
  --triples <path_to_wikidata_triples.json> \
  --wordnet <path_to_wordnet_relations.json> \
  --ast <path_to_ast_dir>
```

### 10.2 What the Engine Reads

| File                     | Produced by                                              | Used for                           |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `feature_labels.json`    | `larql-knowledge` probe pipeline                         | Probe-confirmed per-feature labels |
| `relation_clusters.json` | `larql` vindex build + `larql-knowledge` triples/WordNet | Cluster-based labels               |
| `feature_clusters.jsonl` | `larql` vindex build                                     | Per-feature cluster assignments    |

### 10.3 Additive Updates

Labels are additive. New probes add new feature labels without removing existing ones. New triples improve cluster labels for unprobed features. The `larql label` command merges incrementally:

```bash
# Add new probe results — keeps existing, adds new
larql label gemma3-4b.vindex \
  --probes probes/batch2/feature_labels.json

# Re-cluster with new triples — improves cluster labels only
larql label gemma3-4b.vindex \
  --triples data/wikidata_triples_v2.json
```

## 11. Future Extensions (Not for V1)

### 11.1 Cross-Model DIFF

Compare what one model knows versus another about the same entity or relation. The Procrustes alignment work (0.946 cosine across models) means knowledge coordinates map between architectures.

```sql
-- What does Llama know about France that Gemma doesn't?
DIFF "gemma3-4b.vindex" "llama3-8b.vindex"
    ENTITY "France";
-- Gemma has:  capital→Paris, language→French, continent→Europe
-- Llama adds: population→67M, anthem→La Marseillaise, motto→Liberté

-- Which model has more knowledge about music?
DIFF "gemma3-4b.vindex" "llama3-8b.vindex"
    RELATION "instrument";
-- Gemma: 4 features (guitar, piano, saxophone, drums)
-- Llama: 11 features (+ violin, cello, flute, trumpet, bass, harmonica, banjo)

-- Full knowledge comparison report
DIFF "gemma3-4b.vindex" "llama3-70b.vindex"
    INTO REPORT "model-comparison.md";
```

This answers a question nobody can answer today: "what does this model know that that model doesn't?" The vindex makes it a database query instead of a research project.

### 11.2 Search Across Entities

Reverse DESCRIBE — instead of "what does the model know about France?" ask "which entities have this relation?"

```sql
-- Which entities have a capital?
SELECT entity, target FROM EDGES
    WHERE relation = "capital"
    ORDER BY confidence DESC;
-- France→Paris, Germany→Berlin, Japan→Tokyo, UK→London, ...

-- What does the model think is in Europe?
SELECT entity FROM EDGES
    WHERE relation = "continent"
    AND target = "Europe";
-- France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland, ...

-- Find all composers the model knows
SELECT entity, target FROM EDGES
    WHERE relation = "occupation"
    AND target LIKE "%composer%";
-- Mozart→composer, Beethoven→composer, Bach→composer, ...
```

This is full-text search across the model's entire knowledge graph. No inference, no prompting — just index lookups against the gate vectors and labels.

### 11.3 Export to Standard Knowledge Graph Formats

Dump the model's knowledge as standard graph formats, making it queryable by every graph database, SPARQL endpoint, and visualisation tool in the world.

```sql
EXPORT CURRENT
    INTO "gemma3-4b-knowledge.ttl"
    FORMAT turtle;
-- RDF triples: <France> <capital> <Paris> .
--              <France> <language> <French> .

EXPORT CURRENT
    INTO "gemma3-4b-knowledge.csv"
    FORMAT neo4j;
-- CSV import files for Neo4j: nodes.csv, relationships.csv

EXPORT CURRENT
    INTO "gemma3-4b-knowledge.jsonld"
    FORMAT json-ld;
-- JSON-LD linked data format

EXPORT CURRENT
    INTO "gemma3-4b-knowledge.graphml"
    FORMAT graphml;
-- GraphML for visualisation in Gephi, yEd, Cytoscape
```

The export includes only probe-confirmed and high-confidence cluster labels — not raw TF-IDF fallbacks. The resulting knowledge graph is a curated extraction of what the model actually knows, in formats the entire graph database ecosystem can consume.

### 11.4 Temporal Snapshots

Compare vindexes built from different training checkpoints to see what the model learned between runs.

```sql
-- Build vindexes from two checkpoints of the same model
-- (or two different versions: Llama 2 vs Llama 3)

DIFF "llama2-7b.vindex" "llama3-8b.vindex"
    INTO REPORT "llama-evolution.md";
-- New relations in Llama 3: 47 types not in Llama 2
-- Removed relations: 3 types (deprecated knowledge)
-- Strengthened: capital edges +40% confidence
-- New entities: 12,000 entities Llama 3 knows that Llama 2 doesn't

DIFF "gemma2-2b.vindex" "gemma3-4b.vindex"
    RELATION "capital";
-- Gemma 2: 80 countries with capital edges
-- Gemma 3: 180 countries with capital edges (100 new)
```

Model archaeology. Track how knowledge accumulates across training runs, model families, and parameter scales. See which facts are stable across versions and which are volatile.

### 11.5 Streaming Queries

For large models with hundreds of edges per entity, return results progressively:

```sql
-- Stream edges as they're found, layer by layer
DESCRIBE "France" STREAM;
-- L14: (nothing yet)
-- L15: language → French (probe)
-- L18: borders → Spain (probe)
-- ...results appear as each layer is scanned

-- Useful for remote vindexes — start seeing results before the full scan completes
USE REMOTE "https://models.example.com/llama-70b.vindex";
DESCRIBE "Einstein" STREAM LIMIT 20;
```

The layer-level byte offsets in gate_vectors.bin enable this — each layer can be fetched and scanned independently. For remote vindexes, the client sees results from L14 while L15-27 are still downloading.

### 11.6 Planned LQL Surfaces (machinery exists, language doesn't)

These are not aspirational research — the underlying capabilities live in
`larql-inference` and `larql-vindex` today. They are listed here because
the LQL surface for them has not yet landed, and the spec previously
described grammars that did not match the parser.

- **`TRACE ... DIFF <prompt_b> [AT LAYER <n>]`** — cross-prompt comparison
  of two captured traces (cosine, delta_norm, side-by-side top-1).
- **Tiered SAVE formats on TRACE** — `FORMAT {trace | boundary | context}`,
  `TIER {1..4}`, `WINDOW <n>` clauses to drive the existing trace stores
  (see §11.8). The on-disk formats already exist; only the LQL surface
  is missing.
- **`BOUNDARY OPEN <path>` / `BOUNDARY <path> AT <n>`** — open a boundary
  store for querying and read a specific boundary residual.
- **DESCRIBE STREAM** — progressive layer-by-layer DESCRIBE, particularly
  useful with `USE REMOTE`.
- **End-to-end validation of the Rust refine + decoy pipeline on a real
  model.** `COMPILE INTO VINDEX` bakes gate/up/down overlays into a
  standalone vindex (validated 10/10 retrieval, 0/4 bleed on Gemma 3 4B).
  INSERT handles bleed defense at install time via batch refine against
  cached decoy residuals, so no compile-time refine step is needed.
  `COMPILE INTO MODEL` uses MEMIT closed-form weight editing to write
  inserted facts into W_down at the install layer(s), producing plain
  safetensors with no vindex dependency.

### 11.7 Additional Future Work

- **STEER** — relation steering via ±Δ vectors at a layer. Proven (8/8) but complex to expose cleanly.
- **CHAIN** — multi-hop via L24 residual injection. Proven (KL<0.06) but requires model loaded.
- **LIFT** — analogy operation (same edge, different node). Proven but needs model.
- **GRAPH ALGORITHMS** — PageRank, community detection, shortest path across the knowledge graph.
- **INGEST** — document → context graph extraction (Mode 5, the Apollo demo).
- **Training from graph** — compile an edited knowledge graph back to weights, bypassing gradient descent entirely.

### 11.8 Attention Template Cache (Partially Proven)

99% of attention heads produce fixed patterns across entity substitutions for the same query template (confirmed). Within a known entity set, 11D projection replaces attention perfectly (15/15, K=11). However, generalization to unseen entities fails (0/21) — the entity signal is a nonlinear function of the residual stream, not the raw embedding. Full attention replacement remains open research.

**Status:** Template fixedness confirmed. Within-set replacement proven. Generalization blocked by the nonlinear embedding→residual mapping. The residual stream trace (Section 3.7) provides the ground-truth decomposition for continued research.

### 11.9 Tiered Context Store (Proven)

The residual stream trace enables infinite context without KV cache. Boundary residuals (10 KB per 200-token window) carry the complete Markov state. Tiered storage provides accuracy/storage tradeoffs:

- **Tier 1:** 10 KB/window, 3100× compression vs KV cache (boundary residual only)
- **Tier 4 int8:** 58 KB/window, 511× compression (bit-perfect reconstruction, no replay)

370K tokens (Apollo 11 transcript): 55-110 MB vs 56 GB KV cache.

**Status:** Implemented in `trace/` module. File formats: `.bin` (full chains), `.bndx` (boundaries), `.ctxt` (tiered context). Mmap'd, append-only, zero-copy. See `docs/residual-trace.md` and `docs/specs/trace-format-spec.md`.
