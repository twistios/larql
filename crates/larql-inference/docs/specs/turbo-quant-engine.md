## 1. Purpose

`TurboQuantEngine` is a compressed-K/V engine: every K/V row is
stored as a WHT (Walsh-Hadamard Transform) rotation + Lloyd-Max
scalar quantisation at 3 or 4 bits per coordinate, plus a stored
scalar norm. The codec is stateless (deterministic transform of
each vector) and gives ~3.9× compression at 4 bits vs raw f32 K/V
with cosine similarity ≈ 0.991 on real K/V distributions.

Use case: long-context decode on memory-constrained machines where
the K/V cache is the binding constraint. `TurboQuantEngine`'s hot
state on Gemma 3 4B (window=512, 34 layers) is ~0.6 MB vs
`markov_residual`'s 10.8 MB — 18× smaller — for similar accuracy.

The engine is **lossy by design**. Don't use it where bit-identity
to `StandardEngine` is required. See §2.1 for the actual contract.

## 2. Contract

### 2.1 Accuracy contract

> For any K/V row `(k, v)`, the codec round-trip
> `decode(encode(k))` satisfies `cosine(k, decoded_k) ≥ 0.88` at
> 4 bits on unit-norm vectors with random direction; `≥ 0.85` at
> 3 bits. Real K/V vectors (post-QK-norm) hit cosine ≈ 0.991 at
> 4 bits and ≈ 0.985 at 3 bits because they're not maximally
> adversarial.

This is a **per-row cosine** bound, not a hidden-state cosine bound.
End-to-end accuracy (KL on the output distribution, hidden-state
cosine to `StandardEngine`) is observed but not bounded by spec —
the engine's identity is "WHT + Lloyd-Max with these bit-widths,"
not "any encoding satisfying KL ≤ X."

### 2.2 Memory contract

> Hot state: `O(num_layers × num_kv_rows × bytes_per_row)` where
> `bytes_per_row = num_kv_heads × (4 (stored norm) + ceil(head_dim
> × bits / 8))` (norm + packed indices per head).

Measured on the 10-token bench (Gemma 3 4B, window=512, bits=4):
**0.6 MB hot**, cold tier unused at this prompt length — 18× less
than `markov_residual`'s 10.8 MB. Compression ratio vs raw f32 K/V
is ~3.9× at 4 bits / ~5.0× at 3 bits.

### 2.3 Per-layer compression cycle

Every decode step, for every layer:

1. **Decompress** the layer's stored `CompressedLayer` →
   `(K_prior, V_prior)` (full prior K/V as f32).
2. **Append** the new K/V row from the layer's attention block.
3. **Re-compress** `(K_full, V_full)` → new `CompressedLayer`.

The decompress + recompress cycle is the inner-loop cost — ~17 ms
of CPU codec work on Gemma 3 4B per token (Metal kernel +
per-layer commits add ~12 ms on top, giving 30 ms/token measured =
33 tok/s).

## 3. Codec

WHT (Walsh-Hadamard rotation) over head_dim followed by Lloyd-Max
scalar quantisation. The rotation step disperses the input's energy
across coordinates so per-coordinate quantisation has nearly-uniform
error.

| Operation   | Implementation                                                                         |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WHT         | `crates/larql-kv/src/engines/turbo_quant/rotation.rs` — in-place butterfly, O(d log d) |
| Codebook    | `engines/turbo_quant/codebooks.rs` — pre-computed Lloyd-Max centroids per (dim, bits)  |
| Bit packing | `engines/turbo_quant/packing.rs` — 3-bit and 4-bit variants                            |

The codec is **scalar f32** today; SIMD vectorisation (NEON/AVX2)
of the rotation step is a P1 follow-up — would close most of the
remaining gap between TurboQuant (33 tok/s) and the cached-K/V
engines (58 tok/s).

---

## 4. W1-GPU integration (2026-05-17)

`try_prefill_via_dispatch` + `decode_step_via_dispatch` route per-
layer compute through the Metal fused kernel via
`KvDispatch::coarse_*_with_state`. State capture gives per-layer
new K/V rows directly; the engine handles the compression cycle
on CPU after the Metal kernel commits.

Bench result: **19.6 → 33.0 tok/s on Metal (+68%)**. The smaller
speedup vs markov_residual (+115%) reflects the codec encode/decode
work in the inner loop that markov_residual doesn't pay.

## 5. Implementation

| Concern                  | Location                                                           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Engine + `KvEngine` impl | `crates/larql-kv/src/engines/turbo_quant/engine.rs`                |
| `TurboQuant` codec       | same file, `pub struct TurboQuant { bits: u8 }`                    |
| `CompressedLayer`        | same file — per-layer compressed K + V bytes                       |
| W1-GPU dispatch helpers  | `engine.rs::try_prefill_via_dispatch` + `decode_step_via_dispatch` |

---

## 6. P1 follow-ups (from ROADMAP)

- **Incremental encode of the new K/V row only** (W3): today the
  full layer K/V is re-encoded on every step. Only the new row
  changes — encoding just that row drops ~30× work at long context.
- **SIMD WHT + Lloyd-Max** (W4): scalar f32 today. NEON on Apple
  Silicon, AVX2 on x86_64. ~2-4× on the codec step.
- **Compressed-domain attention** (research): WHT preserves dot
  products under rotation; Q @ K can be computed in the WHT domain
  without decompressing the full prior K/V. Skips ~80% of the
  decompress work.

---

## 7. Non-goals

- **Bit-identity to `StandardEngine`.** The engine is lossy by
  design. Don't claim "exact under contract" — `TurboQuant`'s
  contract is the per-row cosine bound in §2.1.
- **Stateful codec (e.g. predictive coding).** Each K/V row is
  encoded independently; no inter-row prediction. This makes the
  decompress path O(1) per row instead of O(seq_len).
- **Cold tier.** TurboQuant compresses the *hot* K/V in-place;
  there is no separate cold-tier eviction. For windowed bounded
  memory + compressed cold tier, use `markov_residual_codec`.
