# LARQL Roadmap

Top-level plan. Per-crate detail lives in each crate's own `ROADMAP.md`.
This file tracks the demo narrative, the critical path, and cross-crate sequencing.

## Engine purpose (load-bearing — read first)

### The ultimate aim

> **Serve the largest models at blazing speed on consumer hardware, with as little GPU as possible — ideally eventually none.**

Frontier-scale models (100B–1T+ params) are physically incompatible with
consumer hardware under naïve dense matmul: a 671B Q4 model touches
~336 GB per forward pass; consumer DDR5 is ~50 GB/s; that's 6.7 sec/token.
The bandwidth wall cannot be beaten by faster compute. The *only* path
through is **touching fewer weights per token** — sparse retrieval over a
queryable weight database. Vindex was always for this.

Every invention in the codebase serves this aim:

| Invention                                                      | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Combined effect (rough math, ORIGINAL projection): hash routing 5× × FP4 2× × KV
compression 10× = **100× effective bandwidth reduction** on the right
corpus. **Revised 2026-05-31: hash-routing 5× FALSIFIED (V1, doesn't compound); FP4 2× confirmed (V2). The compound is smaller — see the achievability table + `docs/diagnoses/`.**
670 GB model → 6.7 GB-equivalent traffic → ~134 ms/token on
consumer DDR5. That's blazing.

### Two permanent tracks

The aim demands both competitive performance *now* and progress toward
GPU-free *eventually*. These are co-equal tracks, neither sacrifices to
the other:

1. **GPU track** — maintains competitive baseline against ollama / vLLM /
   llama.cpp on Metal (and eventually CUDA/ROCm if substrate-relevant
   experiments demand them). Permanent. Never demoted in favour of CPU
   work. Without this, every claim measured on the engine fails the
   credibility threshold below.

2. **CPU track** — drives toward "blazing big models on consumer hardware
   without GPU." The ultimate aim. Built **in addition to**, not instead
   of, the GPU track.

**Architecture rule that makes the dual-track tractable**: vindex /
WalkFfn / sparse retrieval is the shared invention. Only kernels differ.
No GPU-only paths in the core design. Every technique developed on one
track must have a path to the other, or be architected
device-agnostically from the start (the verify-loop in MTP2 is a current
example: device-agnostic decode with device-specific kernels under it).

### Why "research substrate" framing is the means, not the end

LARQL **is** a research substrate — but substrate-for-its-own-sake isn't
the goal. The substrate exists because the techniques that make the
ultimate aim possible (sparse retrieval, hash routing, FP4, KV
compression, expert sharding, AOT compilation, boundary refs) have to
be developed *somewhere*. LARQL is that somewhere.

This means:

- Adoption, OpenAI-API ergonomics, multi-tenant batched serving, MCP
  ergonomics, and other "production engine" concerns are out of scope
  **except** where they accelerate experiments or affect measurement
  credibility.
- LARQL is not a production inference engine and will not become one in
  the *commercial* sense. But it must operate at production-engine
  baseline performance on its leading device class — otherwise the

### Achievability (honest assessment 2026-05-09)

The aim is **conditionally achievable, asymmetric across model class**. The
arithmetic decides — let's run it.

**MoE frontier models (671B with ~37B active, DeepSeek-V3 class)**

Active params per token = ~37B. At Q4 = 18.5 GB touched. Consumer DDR5 = 50 GB/s
→ **370 ms/token = 2.7 tok/s, just from MoE sparsity alone**.

Stack the techniques:

| Stage                                                                                  | Bytes touched/token | tok/s on 50 GB/s DDR5 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Naïve dense over active experts                                                        | 18.5 GB             | 2.7                   |
| ~~+ hash-routed FFN within active experts (5×)~~ **FALSIFIED (V1) — doesn't compound** | —                   | —                     |
| + FP4 (2×, **confirmed V2**)                                                           | 9.3 GB              | ~5.4                  |
| + KV compression on long context                                                       | depends             | further win           |

**This is where the field is going** — DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick,
Gemma 4 26B-A4B, GPT-OSS family are all MoE. The aim hits this case.

**Dense frontier models (hypothetical 2T dense)**

1 TB at Q4. ~~Hash routing 5× → 200 GB.~~ (hash-routing 5× FALSIFIED, V1). FP4 2× → 500 GB. At 50 GB/s →
**10 sec/token. Not blazing** (worse than the original 2 sec/token estimate once the
hash-routing multiplier is removed). Would need attention sparsification too, open research.

**>RAM models (e.g. 671B = 336 GB on 64 GB consumer)**

NVMe-resident vindex via mmap. Hash routing makes access sparse-but-
predictable; MoE routing has cross-token locality. Keep hot experts in
RAM, page rare ones from disk. **Untested at scale; this is the riskiest
single piece.**

**Distributed across consumer machines (C9 territory)**

Per-token cross-node bandwidth for expert-grid: ~256 KB at frontier MoE
scale. 1 GbE carries 488 tok/s of network capacity. **Network is not
the bottleneck.**

#### What could kill the aim

The "100× combined effect" assumes the techniques compound multiplicatively.
ADR-015 ("isolated kernel speedup ≠ end-to-end win") says they often don't —
and D-RMS-FUSE Phase 1 (2026-05-09) gave us a concrete falsification: predicted
~0.2 ms/tok savings collapsed to zero. So we already have one data point that
compounds *don't* always materialise. The honest path requires **falsifying the
remaining assumptions early**, before committing years to a build that rests on
them. See **"P0 — Aim-validation tests (V1–V4)"** below — these gate the
medium/long/ultimate tiers and are the highest-leverage move available
right now. Four load-bearing assumptions, four tests (V1–V3 isolated, V4
compound).

#### Known unknowns (added 2026-05-09)

The bandwidth math above assumes the architecture cooperates with sparse

| KU3 | FP4 friendliness across non-Gemma archs                              | **RESOLVED 2026-05-31 — CONFIRMED.** V2 measured original f16 weights on Gemma 3 4B + Granite 4.1 3B + 8B (2 families, scale ladder): ≥99.8% per-feature R<16 (reproduces exp 26's 99.83% on gemma3 down exactly; `down` the only mild tail). Predictive: FP4 E2M1 within +0.116 bits/token of f32 and *beats* the shipped Q4-int baseline. See [`docs/diagnoses/v2-fp4-generality.md`](docs/diagnoses/v2-fp4-generality.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | V2 resolved it: FP4 is a real free ~2×, no per-arch QAT for the families measured. Llama/Mistral/MoE-expert weights not yet covered (need f16 exports).                                                                                                                                                                     |
| KU4 | Hash-routing compounding across all layers                           | **RESOLVED 2026-05-31 (dense) — FALSIFIED.** V1 measured 3 dense archs (Gemma 3 4B, Llama 2 7B, Mistral 7B): per-layer KL ≤ 0.05 thresholds (mean 2.7–12.2% of features) **do not compound** — applied simultaneously they give +5.4 to +7.7 bits/token NLL and 78–95% argmax drift. The per-layer screen is anti-correlated with the truth (sparser screen → worse collapse). Realisable bandwidth ~2.4–2.9× (not 5×) and catastrophic anyway. **MoE-within-expert version still OPEN** (the dense harness measures the wrong object on the 26B). See [`docs/diagnoses/v1-hash-routing.md`](docs/diagnoses/v1-hash-routing.md).                        | V1 resolved the dense case. The 5× *within-FFN* bandwidth multiplier is gone; MoE confidence now rests on expert active-param sparsity, not FFN hash routing.                                                                                                                                                               |
| KU5 | mmap thrash on disk-resident frontier models                         | **RESOLVED 2026-05-31 — locality is POOR (negative for the long-term tier).** Two halves: (a) V3 cold-read latency — cold scattered 16 KB read ~100µs p50/140µs p99, warm ~0.04µs (~2380×); (b) MoE routing locality (faithful in-process 26B-A4B decode): per-token routing is sparse (8/128) but the **working set saturates to ~124/128 experts over a sequence — the uniform-random expectation** (load-balanced router), so there is NO small cacheable hot subset. See [`docs/diagnoses/v3-disk-resident-mmap.md`](docs/diagnoses/v3-disk-resident-mmap.md) + [`docs/diagnoses/moe-routing-locality.md`](docs/diagnoses/moe-routing-locality.md). | 26B's full expert set (~11 GB) fits RAM → fine after warmup. But a **>RAM frontier MoE can't keep a hot fraction resident** (working set ≈ whole population) → sustained paging (~200 ms/token-class). The disk-residency bet for the long-term tier is **undermined**. Cross-MoE generality (non-Gemma router) still open. |

KU3, KU4, KU5 are scheduled to be resolved by V1–V3 below. KU1 and KU2 are
not currently scheduled — KU1 lands when 31B work matures enough to measure
head staticity; KU2 is parked behind BR4 because the workaround is on the
roadmap even if the underlying fix isn't.

### Baseline-credibility threshold (acceptance criterion)

> LARQL must be within **10% of llama.cpp / ollama** on the matching
> model + quantisation + context-length configuration **on the device
> class the claim is being made on**, before any *"+N% from technique X"*
> claim is published. CPU technique → CPU baseline. GPU technique → GPU
> baseline.

Items the threshold makes load-bearing (not optional) on the **GPU track**:
- **D-ATTN-MTG** — flash attention; without it, attention-mechanism deltas are muddied by missing baseline.
- **D-PREFILL-MM2** — `simdgroup_matrix` matmul; until landed, prefill claims fail the threshold.
- **D-METAL-PLE** — without it, every Gemma 4 E2B experiment runs CPU-fallback and any delta is unattributable.
- **MTP1–MTP6** — Gemma 4 MTP drafters are now part of the state-of-the-art baseline (Ollama supports them).
- **AI1–AI6** — cross-arch deltas need clean arch boundaries.
- **Coverage → 90%** — measurement integrity needs correctness trust.

Items the threshold makes load-bearing on the **CPU track** (see new
"P0 — CPU path to blazing" section below):
- Critical-path #4 — CPU MoE forward pass.
- WalkFfn as primary CPU decode path.
- Hash-routed FFN (exp 27 → product).
- FP4 productisation (exp 26 → product).
- mmap'd vindex with lazy disk-resident edges.
- AMX / AVX-512 / Apple AMX kernels.
- KV compression as default for long context.
- BR4 (boundary refs Phase 4).

Items the threshold makes **explicitly out of scope** (both tracks):
- **CB1, CB2** (continuous batching, PagedAttention) — concurrency-throughput, not single-stream baseline.
- **MCP1** (MCP server) — UX, doesn't change measurement.
- **TM1** (thinking-mode toggle) — UX, doesn't change measurement.
- OpenAI API compatibility beyond what experiments call.

## Strategic priorities (review 2026-05-28)

Layered on the achievability analysis above after the 2026-05-28 whole-codebase
review. These are **organizational / sequencing** decisions — they re-prioritise
existing roadmap items, they do not replace ADR-019 or the V1–V4 design.

**1. One gated critical path. V1–V4 is the only true P0.**
The medium/long/ultimate tiers (62 / 52 / 30%, revised 2026-05-31) are *conditional* on the compound
assumption, and we already hold two falsifications of compounds not materialising
(ADR-015, D-RMS-FUSE → 0). So everything currently labelled P0 except
aim-validation is downgraded to **"P0-conditional — unblocked by V1–V4"**:
Engine↔Backend unification, the CPU-path-to-blazing build-out, and the
best-in-class mech-interp engine. They stay important; they are not *first*.
Rationale: when seven sections are P0, the falsification gate competes with a
6–12 month refactor and loses. (ROADMAP_STATUS.md's single ordered Active
Sequence is the canonical "what's now"; this section makes the main roadmap
agree with it.)

**2. Pull a minimal V3 (disk-resident mmap) spike forward, in parallel with V1.**
V3 tests KU5 (mmap thrash on >RAM models) — named above as "the riskiest single
piece" and the gate for the long-term + ultimate tiers. It is currently queued
*behind* V1/V2, which is backwards on information value: V3 is the most likely to
fail and reshapes the most plan if it does. A throwaway spike (≥70B-class MoE
vindex on NVMe; measure page-fault rate under MoE routing locality on a single
decode stream) is worth more than a clean V1, because "models that exceed RAM"
*is* the frontier-on-consumer story. A negative result shrinks the aim to
"models that fit in RAM" — which we want to know *before* the backend rewrite,
not after.

**3. GPU track = credibility tax. Spend the minimum to stay "defensible".**
GPU's job is the baseline-credibility threshold, not parity — and it is a
treadmill (ollama shipping MTP widened the Gemma-4 gap 1.17× → 2.6× through no
change of ours). Of the load-bearing GPU items, **D-PREFILL-MM2 (the 14× prefill
gap) is the only one that actually invalidates published claims today** — any
prefill-sensitive measurement fails the threshold until it lands. Prioritise it
over further decode tok/s. Treat MTP1–6 as baseline-*matching* (don't innovate
there). D-ATTN-MTG / D-METAL-PLE stay load-bearing but sit behind D-PREFILL-MM2.

**4. MoE-first functionality; dense is for experiment velocity, not the destination.**
The sharpest fact in the achievability table is the MoE/dense asymmetry (62% vs
10%, revised 2026-05-31) and the field is all-MoE (DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4, Gemma 4, GPT-OSS). The
crown-jewel functionality is therefore **CPU MoE forward + hash-routed FFN +
disk-resident expert paging** — the three things that prove the 80% / 60% tiers.
ADR-019 making dense-31B substrate-primary is fine for velocity, but the
functionality emphasis must stay MoE-first: watch that the dense path doesn't
accrete features while the MoE path (the actual bet) stays thin.

**5. Deepen the database surface — it's the moat (see next section).**

---

## Query / Edit / Interpret — first-class functionality track (added 2026-05-28)

**Thesis: the differentiated functionality is the database, not the tok/s.**

The performance race against ollama / vLLM / llama.cpp is a *credibility*
exercise — they will always win raw speed because that is their entire job, and
the threshold only asks us to stay within 10%. But "query, edit, and interpret
the model like a graph database" — `DESCRIBE`, `INSERT INTO EDGES`, `walk`,
MEMIT / AOT compilation — is a genuine moat with **no competitor**. This is where
LARQL is *ahead* instead of chasing.

Until now this surface has been framed as a *means* to sparsity ("discover which
weights do the work, so the rest stays on disk"). That undersells it. Promote it
to a co-equal functionality track with its own exit criteria:

- **Harden the experiment surface into LQL verbs.** A large amount of the
  differentiated capability lives in `experiments/` rather than in shipped LQL:
  vindex compilation (10/10 retrieval), MEMIT fact insertion, AOT program
  compilation (zero-drift), passage compilation, two-level routing, the
  WASM-in-FFN / VM-in-residual primitives. These are product, not just papers.
  Sequence them into first-class, tested LQL / CLI verbs at the same coverage
  floor as the rest of the workspace.
- **Make edit durable + safe.** INSERT / COMPOSE / compile paths need the
  commit-semantics + truthfulness guarantees the interpretability-truthfulness
  P0 is already chasing (TRACE parity), so an edit is verifiable and reversible.
- **Lower risk than the compound.** This track does not depend on the 100×
  compound materialising. It compounds the one durable advantage regardless of
  whether V1–V4 confirm the bandwidth math — which makes it the right hedge to
  fund *alongside* aim-validation, not after it.

**Exit criterion:** the README's `INSERT` / `DESCRIBE` / `walk` / compile demo is
backed end-to-end by tested LQL verbs (not example scripts), with edits
verifiable via TRACE parity and reversible.

### FR — Fleet routing extensions (added 2026-06-07)

Four routing/edit explorations seeded by the `chris-experiments/fleet`
native-store arc (E10–E17) and the `videos/the-mechanism` build story — the
fleet and LARQL's KNN/COMPOSE converged on the same architecture
(`fleet/SYNTHESIS.md` §9). **Measurement-experiment-first:** each item runs its
falsification probe on a real LARQL vindex, in predictive units (recall@k / NLL /
KL / drift / confident-wrong — mean-P/mean-cosine banned), **before** any build;
builds land parity-first (default off = byte-identical). Full spec + frozen
pre-registrations: [`docs/fleet-routing-extensions.md`](docs/fleet-routing-extensions.md).

The mechanism: factual memory is addressed by **(relation, entity) → value**; the
relation is a *clean* semantic index, the entity is *top-k fuzzy*; the model
*addresses*, it does not *unpack*; and operations split at linear-aggregate (rides
free) vs joint-nonlinear (walls). FR1 ⊂ FR2 (top-k is the fuzzy tier of the
two-tier router). FR3 is the cleanest standalone win; FR4 is research-first.

| FR3b | **Explicit relation rewrite — phrasing-robust fallback.** FR3's probe is synonym-robust but **phrasing-brittle**: 1.00 was synonym *words* in one template; on an unseen *phrasing* it's at **chance** at its L10 probe layer, and more training templates = **no-op** (reverted). **MEASURED ✅ (2026-06-08, Gemma-3-4B):** explicit few-shot `word→relation` classify (1 forward, `predict_kquant`) = **12/12** synonyms + unseen phrasings (head city→capital, legal tender→currency, mother tongue→language — exactly the probe's chance cases), but forced-choice confident-wrongs distractors **2/3** (weather/altitude→capital) → add a `none` escape → **0/3** (all abstain), 12/12 kept. The `none` escape = the verify/abstain (the project's recurring confident-wrong trap, cf. FR1 gate). **BUILT ✅ (2026-06-09): probe-first / explicit-classify-with-`none` fallback** in `resolve_relation_synonym` (FR2 two-tier shape) — Tier 1 probe (cheap, on confidence) → Tier 2 `resolve_relation_explicit` on abstain (few-shot+`none` frame lifted from the harness; one full forward via `InferenceWeights::predict_dense` = the INFER path's `predict_kquant`+lm_head, since `RelationResolver` only dequantises `0..=L10`; `none`-gated `match_relation_top1`). Opt-in `LARQL_FR3_EXPLICIT`, default off = byte-identical. **Real-vindex fix:** prod vindex has 2890 noisy labels; alphabetical top-64 dropped `language`/kept `food_animal` (mother-tongue failed, banana resolved — backwards) → `RelationClassifier::relation_labels_ranked` (by feature count) for Tier 2 candidates. **E2E real Gemma-3-4B:** `mother tongue`→`language` by explicit (0.97, probe abstained — the win); `weather`→abstain (none-escape); default off → no resolution.

| FR4  | **Operation-class dispatch boundary** (E17 compute ladder). Linear-aggregate ops (COUNT/THRESHOLD/MAJORITY) ride the read free; joint-bit (PARITY) walls — **a property of the operation, not the packing**. E17's own ledger demotes the E4 bridge to a **conjecture** (G/O/T never ran). Measure first = run the real external ops (distance/argmin/optimization) on the E17 rig to close that conjecture, then map LQL aggregate verbs. **MEASURED ✅ (2026-06-07, conjecture REFINED):** ran the real external ops on the E17 rig — **DIST (geometric) + ARGMIN (selection) RIDE free at L1**, only **PARTITION (global optimization) walls like parity**. Parity was NOT a fair stand-in for "external"; E4 mis-files geometric/selection (they're internal). Real line = factors-through-reads vs global-joint. Dispatch consequence: keep count/filter/aggregate/threshold/majority/distance/argmin internal, route global-optimization+parity external. `fleet/E17_compute_ladder/E17_EXTERNAL_VERDICT.md`.

## Video pipeline (added 2026-05-09)

The roadmap is not just engineering items; many of them are gated on
producing video evidence and many videos are gated on engineering items
landing. This section maps the dependencies explicitly so neither side
drifts.

(V-prefix reserved for aim-validation tests; videos use VID-prefix to
avoid collision.)

| #    | Video                                                                                                         | Status                | Engineering dependencies                                                                              | Roadmap items               |

| VID5 | "No KV Cache" (full Markov RS arc + boundary refs)                                                            | Planned               | BR4 (server integration), softmax bottleneck KU2 acknowledged                                         | BR4, BR5                    |
| VID6 | "Build a Fresh Model From Scratch"                                                                            | Planned               | n/a (research)                                                                                        | n/a                         |
| VID7 | "I Killed Attention" (decoupling attention from FFN; static/semi-static/dynamic head taxonomy)                | Sketched, not drafted | Static-head taxonomy at 31B (KU1), MTP6 acceptance-rate evidence, D-ATTN-MTG flash attention baseline | KU1, MTP6, D-ATTN-MTG       |

**Key cross-link**: VID7's central claim ("91% of attention heads are
static routing, not computation") is *also* what makes MTP work — MTP
exploits exactly the staticity VID7 claims. So MTP6's per-token acceptance
rate over a corpus is a direct measurement of the static-attention
fraction VID7 claims, *per architecture*. Landing MTP1–MTP6 produces both
a baseline-credibility number (Ollama parity) and substrate evidence
(VID7's central thesis at scale). Treat MTP6 as a substrate-and-baseline
item, not just a competitive-parity item.

- **Gemma 3 4B Metal**: **88 tok/s** (Ollama steady: ~103). **Gap: 1.17×** (was 1.18× pre QKV defuse, 1.30× pre 2026-05-02 dispatch-geometry fix). **Acceptance criterion (~85 tok/s, 1.16×) met.**
- **Gemma 4 26B A4B Metal**: **19.4 tok/s** (was 5.1 — bug-locked under the same dispatch-geometry mismatch; correct multilingual output now).
- **Cross-arch coverage validated** (2026-05-09): Gemma 3, Gemma 4 31B dense, Llama 2 7B, Mistral 7B all dispatch correctly through Metal. Gemma 4 E2B falls back to CPU (deliberate — Metal doesn't yet implement Per-Layer Embeddings; diagnosed and tracked as D-METAL-PLE).
- **Grid (CPU MoE on remote shards)**: 18.3 tok/s 1-shard / 17.3 tok/s 2-shard local-loopback. Multi-host LAN/cross-region scaling unblocked.
- **Remote FFN (dense)**: `larql run --ffn URL` + `larql serve --ffn-only` wired end-to-end.
- **gRPC grid**: 2-shard self-assembling grid live-validated on 26B A4B.
- **4 KV-cache engines**: MarkovRS (287×), UnlimitedContext (254×), TurboQuant (4×), Apollo (20,000×) — all at ~95 tok/s on Gemma 3 4B Metal.
- **Wire format negotiation** (2026-05-07): f16 is now the default for all grid traffic (50% bandwidth reduction). i8 symmetric quantised residuals available opt-in (`LARQL_I8_WIRE=1`, 75% reduction). Content-type negotiation via `Accept` header; f32 fallback for non-grid clients.
- **Per-layer latency routing** (2026-05-07): `HeartbeatMsg.layer_stats` carries EMA avg_ms + p99_ms per layer; router routes to the server with lowest per-layer latency (falls back to requests_in_flight when no data yet).
- **WebSocket token streaming** (2026-05-07): `WS /v1/stream` now supports `{"type":"generate","prompt":"...","max_tokens":N}` command with per-token frames and cancel support. SSE streaming on `/v1/chat/completions` was already fully wired.
- **Criterion benchmarks** (2026-05-07): `make bench-wire` (wire codec encode/decode MB/s) and `make bench-routing` (route/heartbeat/rebuild ns/op). `larql-router` now has a library crate (`larql_router::grid`) for test/bench use.
- **Dynamic rebalancing** (2026-05-08): `rebalancer.rs` background task with configurable threshold (--rebalance-interval, --rebalance-threshold). Router detects sustained per-layer latency imbalance and sends `UnassignMsg` to the slow shard; server drains in-flight requests (up to 30s), sends `DroppingMsg`, and re-enters available pool. Real `requests_in_flight` counter wired into heartbeats via `RifGuard` in walk_ffn handler.
- **CI regression gate** (2026-05-08): `scripts/bench-grid-regress.sh` + `scripts/bench_compare.py` + `bench/baselines/`. First run auto-saves baseline; subsequent runs fail if tok/s drops >5% or p99 rises >10%.
- **Shannon arc closed** (2026-05-08): Exps 42–44 prove cross-entropy is a real wire format (Exp 42: 2.0 bits/char vs 6.3 gzip), residual stream is compressible (Exp 43: int8-clip3σ, 98.7% top-1, KL=2.0 nats), gate calibrated at threshold=2.16 (Exp 44: accept=68.9%, early-div=4.8%).
- **`larql-boundary` crate shipped** (2026-05-08): Phases 1–3 of BOUNDARY_REF_PROTOCOL. int8-clip3σ + bf16 codec, per-boundary confidence metadata, calibrated confidence gate. 100% function coverage, CI on Linux/Windows/macOS, 3 examples (encode_decode, gate_decision, accuracy). Phase 4 (server integration) not started.
- **QKV defuse + cleanup pass** (2026-05-09): default flipped from fused `q4k_q6k_qkv_proj_normed` to separate `rms_norm` + non-fused `q4k_q6k_qkv_proj` (+1.6–1.8 tok/s on Gemma 3 4B, +0.4 tok/s on Gemma 4 26B A4B post-thermal-cooldown cross-arch validation, ADR-016). Cross-arch bench captured for 4 model families. Shader inventory survey (47 shaders) + retention rationale doc-blocks added to opt-in shaders. New ADRs: [017 — shader retention under model agnosticity](crates/larql-compute/docs/adr/017-shader-retention-model-agnosticity.md), [018 — architecture → shader routing](crates/larql-compute/docs/adr/018-architecture-shader-routing.md). New docs: [shader-inventory](crates/larql-compute/docs/shader-inventory.md), [architecture-shader-map](crates/larql-compute/docs/architecture-shader-map.md), [llama-cpp-comparison](crates/larql-compute/docs/llama-cpp-comparison.md). One verifiable orphan deleted (`q4k_qkv_proj_v2`).
- **`make bench-cross-arch` shipped** (2026-05-09): runs `larql bench` across the model matrix (Gemma 3 4B, Gemma 4 31B dense, Gemma 4 26B A4B MoE, Llama 2 7B, Mistral 7B). `--save-baseline` / `--compare` modes; `bench/baselines/cross-arch/`. Operationalises ADR-017 model-agnosticity check; multi-arch sweep surfaces thermal artifacts as "every arch regresses simultaneously." Run on a cool machine before saving baselines.
- **D-RMS-FUSE Phase 1 implemented + falsified end-to-end** (2026-05-09): fused post-FFN `residual_add` + next-layer input rms_norm via `residual_norm_store` for the non-Gemma path. Bit-identical parity across Llama 2 7B, Mistral 7B, Gemma 3 4B (Gemma untouched — already triple-fused). End-to-end null vs drift on Llama 2 / Mistral. Kept opt-in `LARQL_FUSED_PRELAYER_NORM=1` per ADR-017 retention. Predicted ~0.2 ms/tok savings collapsed to zero — ADR-015 magnitude-compression at the extreme. Lesson: dispatch-overhead estimates (~7 µs/dispatch) over-predict savings when the kernel being skipped is also short.
- **Gemma 4 E2B 30× anomaly diagnosed** (2026-05-09): root cause = Per-Layer Embeddings (PLE) not implemented in Metal; `gpu.rs:372-374` deliberately routes E2B to CPU. Tracked as **D-METAL-PLE** (1-2 day Metal port of `forward/ple.rs`, 80-150× expected speedup for E2B; unlocks future PLE-using arches like Gemma 4 E4B).
- **larql-compute coverage audit + improvement** (2026-05-09): `cargo llvm-cov` reports **56.03% → 64.81% line coverage** (+8.78 pp; 2,575 newly-covered lines, 22.2% reduction in uncovered LoC). Three rounds: (1) deleted `metal/prefill.rs` (591 LoC of `#[allow(dead_code)]` orphan); (2) targeted tests on small helpers — `tg_width` math (qk_norm 0% → 23%), `scale_vector` dispatch (layer_scalar 12% → 97%), `residual_norm_store` shader parity for D-RMS-FUSE; (3) synthetic end-to-end Metal decode tests (`tests/test_metal_decode_synthetic.rs`, NEW) covering Llama-style + Gemma-3-style + D-RMS-FUSE off-vs-on parity, which lifted `decode/mod.rs` 7% → 61%, `encode_attn` 0% → 46%, `encode_post_ffn` 0% → 83%, `encode_qkv` 0% → 30%, `encode_ffn` 0% → 23%. Coverage policy (`coverage-policy.json`) targets 90% per-file / 93.5% total — current is below but no longer a wide gulf. Largest remaining gaps: `metal/trait_impl/decode.rs` (627 LoC at 21% — MoE / split-profile trait methods), `metal/decode/encode_ffn.rs` (1008 LoC at 23% — Q4_KF / MoE branches), `metal/diag/*.rs` (~3000 LoC at 0% — diagnostic / dev-only).
- **Positioning vs ollama / vLLM / llama.cpp documented** (2026-05-09): [docs/positioning.md](docs/positioning.md). Three-category framing (local single-user / batched serving / research+edit); feature matrix; per-competitor gap analysis; surfaces missing items now tracked under P2 § "Competitive parity" below.
- **Google released Gemma 4 MTP drafters** (2026-05-05, 4 days ago): `google/gemma-4-{E2B,E4B,26B-A4B,31B}-it-assistant` — every Gemma 4 variant LARQL supports. 0.4B BF16 ~4-layer drafter for the 26B-A4B target. Architecture: shared input embeddings + shared KV cache + target last-layer activations concatenated with token embeddings then down-projected to drafter dimension. Measured **2.2× decode speedup on Apple Silicon at speculative batch 4–8** (Google blog), up to 3× generally. Apache 2.0 / CC-BY-4.0. Supported engines: HF Transformers, MLX, vLLM, SGLang, **Ollama**, LiteRT-LM (notably not llama.cpp). Competitive implication: the LARQL gap on Gemma 4 widens from 1.17× to ~2.6× as users adopt MTP on Ollama. Red Hat AI also released an EAGLE-3 speculator for `gemma-4-26B-A4B-it` (0.9B drafter). MTP1 promoted from P2 to **P1** — see new section below.
- **ADR-019 resolved** (2026-05-09): substrate-primary is **Gemma 4 31B dense + vindex**; MoE coverage retained at single-machine scale (Gemma 4 26B-A4B for cross-arch validation, virtual-expert work). Multi-machine MoE grid (C9 productionisation, critical-path items 5–10) demoted from P0 to P2 — substantial production-engineering work with no current experiment requiring "model spans 4 consumer machines" beyond what single-machine sharding already demonstrates. C1 (CPU MoE forward pass) stays P0 because V1/V2 cross-arch sweep on 26B-A4B requires it. See full resolution in "ADR-019" section below.
- **Engine ↔ Backend unification PR shippable** (2026-05-16): three specs landed in `crates/larql-inference/docs/specs/` — (1) [`kv-engine-unification.md`](crates/larql-inference/docs/specs/kv-engine-unification.md) (Steps 1-7 implemented, all parity tests green); (2) [`compute-backend-redesign.md`](crates/larql-inference/docs/specs/compute-backend-redesign.md) (Steps 1-4 implemented — `KvDispatch` sibling trait in larql-inference, `EngineBackend` umbrella, `CpuBackend`/`MetalBackend` scaffolding, `StandardEngine` migrated to dispatch through trait); (3) [`async-compute-backend.md`](crates/larql-inference/docs/specs/async-compute-backend.md) (trait surface locked, 6 open questions resolved; A1 trait + handles, A2 `CpuBackend`, A3 `MetalBackend` scaffold, and A5 `StandardEngine` opt-in landed 2026-05-16 — A3's Metal-feature validation gate is blocked on a parallel `larql-compute-metal` extraction). Honest finding from Step 5 discovery: per-layer Metal kernels at the sync trait's granularity are *slower* than today's fused decode path because each per-layer call forces a separate GPU command-buffer commit — `AsyncComputeBackend` (intent-collector pattern, deferred dispatch) is the prerequisite for any tok/s win. That work is 6-12 months end-to-end (see new "P0 — Engine ↔ Backend unification" section below). The unification PR ships the foundation; tok/s wins land in A4 (real Metal deferred dispatch) and the multi-step Metal kernel work that compounds on top.
- **Cross-engine forward-pass correctness gate** (2026-05-16): `larql shannon verify` orchestrates LARQL Rust forward against HF/PyTorch + MLX reference scorers (subprocesses) on a shared corpus and prints a bits/char delta table. First serious application surfaced **four config-loading bugs in larql-models** — all closed in the loader (no env-var workarounds in production): (1) `rms_norm_eps` from config.json was never read by the trait default; (2) Gemma 3's per-layer-type `rope_scaling` structured form (`{full_attention: {rope_type: linear, factor: 8}, sliding_attention: {rope_type: default}}`) wasn't honoured; (3) `rope_scaling = llama3` (wavelength-dependent per-channel `inv_freq` adjustment) wasn't implemented; (4) `norm_epsilon` alias (StarCoder2's name for `rms_norm_eps`) wasn't recognised. Post-fix, all four affected models match HF F32 to <0.06% bits/char with zero env vars. `scripts/diagnose_models.py` (multi-arch sweep) reports 7/9 PASS. CI gate at `.github/workflows/shannon-verify.yml` runs SmolLM2-135M verify on every PR. Diagnostic doc: [`docs/diagnoses/shannon-cross-engine-divergence.md`](docs/diagnoses/shannon-cross-engine-divergence.md). Plus GPT-2 legacy config-key aliases (`n_embd`/`n_layer`/`n_head`/`n_inner`) parsed via new alias-list machinery in `detect/config_io.rs`.
- **larql-compute-metal coverage push closed** (2026-05-16): post-ADR-019 split, the Metal backend now lives in its own crate with **97.28% line coverage, 59/59 files at the 90% per-file floor, zero debt baselines**. Up from 75.69% (50/59 files clearing 90%, 9 debt baselines) at session start. Key techniques: (1) `MetalBackend::with_options` to bypass the env-snapshot caching that silently no-op'd flag-toggling tests on `decode_one_token_with_env`, opening the `fused_attn` / `fused_qk_norm_rope` / `fused_kv_append_attend` / `fused_post_attn_norm` branches in `decode/encode_attn.rs` (68.78% → 99.53%); (2) per-format prefill split-phase tests (Q4_K / Q4_KF / Q4_0 × gated / non-gated, `LARQL_PROFILE_SPLIT=1`) for `decode/encode_ffn.rs` (61.43% → 92.86%); (3) direct calls to the public `run_experts_prestaged_metal` / `run_experts_preselected_metal` / `run_dense_ffn_q4k` paths plus a real-MoE-layer `decode_token_q4k_moe` end-to-end test for `moe_dispatch.rs` (38.91% → 95.25%); (4) `decode_attention_layer` integration tests covering V-norm, post-norms, and `wo.format` Q4_KF/Q6_K branches for `decode_hybrid.rs` (0% baseline → 94.41%); (5) dead-code deletion of `MetalBackend::full_pipeline` (108 lines, no callers, doc said "old benchmark entry point") to clear `pipeline.rs` to 100%; (6) `Config::from_args` + JSON helper + Smoke-profile end-to-end coverage for `diag/shader_bench.rs` (4.25% → 99.36%) and `diag/kernel_profile.rs` (0% → 97.12%) — the diag scripts now smoke-run real GPU dispatches in unit tests; (7) a dedicated `tests/test_decode_diag.rs` integration binary (fresh process, fresh `CALL_COUNT`) that hits the previously-believed-structural cap on `decode/diag.rs` (85.23% → 93.75%). Coverage-policy file now an empty-baseline gate: any regression on any file breaks CI.
- **larql-router self-healing + HTTP/3 + hedged-dispatch phase** (2026-05-16): MoE expert routing (ADR-0018, per-(layer, expert-range) replication keys), Prometheus `/metrics` (ADR-0017), Phase 4 HTTP/3 shard transport behind `--http3-shards` / `--http3-port` (ADR-0019, h3 0.0.8 + h3-quinn 0.0.10 + h3-axum 0.2), hot-shard hysteresis (ADR-0014 amendment, `--hot-shard-demote-ratio` default 0.8), backpressure tier (ADR-0020 — `--saturation-ceiling N` filter in `route()` / `route_expert()`, dispatcher distinguishes 503 saturation from 400 no-owner via `has_owners_for()`, emits `Retry-After: 0.5`, bumps `larql_router_route_saturation_total`), long-running chaos test (`tests/test_grid_chaos.rs`, 5,000 random ticks × 2 variants, asserts ledger consistency + coverage floor + no `route()` panic), hedged dispatch (ADR-0021 — opt-in via `--hedge-after-ms M`, new `route_with_rank` / `route_expert_with_rank` grid APIs, `hedged_post_json` racing helper, dense + MoE fan-outs wired, `route_hedge_fires_total` / `route_hedge_wins_total` counters; supersedes the original "speculative next-layer prefetch" P1 framing — an audit falsified that framing since the router sees one batched call per token against a single input residual, so hedge-the-slow-primary is the legitimate router-layer optimisation). Concurrent-route bench (`bench_route_concurrent`, 2026-05-16) surfaced lock-contention plateau: pre-swap 1 = 5.6 → 4 = 8.7 → 8 = **4.0** → 16 = 3.6 Melem/s (8 workers *worse* than 1 — pathological). **Lock primitive swap** (2026-05-16): `tokio::sync::RwLock<GridState>` → `parking_lot::RwLock<GridState>` across larql-router and tests. Every grid critical section is short and sync (no `await` held under the lock), so synchronous is semantically correct and the compiler enforces it (parking_lot guards are `!Send`). Post-swap: 1 = 6.4 / 4 = 11.1 / 8 = 7.2 / 16 = 6.1 Melem/s — **+14% / +28% / +80% / +70%**, pathological 8-worker collapse eliminated. 220 tests still pass. Saturation-filter cost on the happy path: ~108 ns vs ~113 ns baseline (in noise); all-saturated short-circuit ~57 ns. Router test surface: 169 lib + 50 integration = **219 tests** (220 with `--features http3`). Coverage **~93%**. Five examples (`embed_grid`, `static_shards_server`, `admin_client`, `fanout_dispatch`, `saturation_backpressure`); criterion benches cover dense + MoE + saturation + concurrent-route. Multi-host deployment runbook at [`crates/larql-router/docs/multi-host-demo.md`](crates/larql-router/docs/multi-host-demo.md). Server-side `GET /v1/shard/{model}/{start}-{end}` audited + documented in [`crates/larql-server/docs/router-spec.md`](crates/larql-server/docs/router-spec.md) §4. ADRs: [0017](docs/adr/0017-prometheus-metrics.md), [0018](docs/adr/0018-moe-expert-routing.md), [0019](docs/adr/0019-http3-shard-transport.md), [0020](docs/adr/0020-route-backpressure-tier.md), [0021](docs/adr/0021-hedged-dispatch.md).
- **Whole-codebase review** (2026-05-28): multi-agent deep review (17 crates, ~415K LOC; per-crate reader + adversarial verification). Clippy clean (2 trivial nits); exposure concentrated and thematic. ~7 verified high/medium items now tracked under "Codebase hardening (review 2026-05-28)" below and mirrored into crate-local roadmaps. Top two confirmed by hand: infallible `FfnBackend::forward` aborts serving on remote-shard blips; Metal KV append has no `pos<max_seq` clamp (GPU OOB past 4096 rows). Record: [`docs/audits/codebase-review-2026-05-28.md`](docs/audits/codebase-review-2026-05-28.md).
- **Follow-up codebase review** (2026-06-12): working-tree diff review (C10 residency + FR3) plus fresh whole-workspace sweep with adversarial verification. Numeric core verified clean (asm kernels, int8 attention, GGUF loader overflow claims all refuted); verified exposure at the edges: `model_id` path traversal in shard loader, zero GPU-error checking across 77 Metal `wait_until_completed` sites, dispatch-geometry duplication back at 2 sites despite `KernelHandle`, corrupt-vindex panics (2026-05-28 item 1 still open), GIL never released in larql-python, 145 env flags / ~18 documented. Tracked under "Follow-up review (2026-06-12)" below; maintenance-debt recommendations under "Cleanup / consolidation track (added 2026-06-12)".

## Codebase hardening (review 2026-05-28)

Whole-codebase multi-agent review (17 crates, ~415K LOC; one reader per crate +
adversarial verification of every high/critical finding). Full record:
[`docs/audits/codebase-review-2026-05-28.md`](docs/audits/codebase-review-2026-05-28.md).
Verdict: mature, defensively-engineered; exposure is concentrated and thematic,
not pervasive. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` is clean (2 trivial nits).
Per-crate items below are mirrored into each crate-local roadmap.

Ordered actions (✅ = also confirmed by hand):

1. **Make `FfnBackend::forward` fallible** (P0) — the trait returns an infallible
   `Array2<f32>`, forcing process-abort on served paths. Convert
   `larql-inference` `cached.rs:123,200`, `hidden.rs:38`, ✅`http.rs:519` and
   `larql-compute` `moe/forward.rs:191,211` to `?`-propagation into the existing
   `GenerateError` channel. Highest leverage — removes the top serving-abort
   class. [larql-inference, larql-compute]
2. ✅ **Bound the Metal KV cache** (P0) — `kv_attention.rs:186-187` (+ `attn_fused`,
   `kv_append_attend_fused`) write `K_cache[pos*total+tid]` with no `pos<max_seq`
   clamp; sessions exceeding the 4096-row cache write OOB on the GPU during
   normal decode. Add the position guard and extend `ensure_prompt_fits` to
   `prompt_len + max_tokens`; expose cache sizing to the caller. The only
   verified memory-corruption bug. [larql-compute-metal — no crate roadmap]
3. **Fix `larql-python` soundness gaps** (P0) — `trace_py.rs:14-28` raw
   `*const ModelWeights`/`*const Tokenizer` is use-after-free across `del model`
   (give `PyResidualTrace` a `Py<PyWalkModel>`); `walk.rs:207-223` zero-copy
   embed `Vec::from_raw_parts` lacks the length check its sibling paths use.
   [larql-python — no crate roadmap]
4. **Validate router layer ranges + wire server eviction** (P1) — `larql-router`
   `routing.rs:237` builds an unbounded route table from gRPC-announced ranges
   (clamp to model depth before `rebuild_route_table`); `larql-server`
   `session.rs:184` + `ratelimit.rs:83` never evict (dead eviction logic).
   Memory/DoS class. [larql-router, larql-server]
5. **Shared NaN-safe top-K/sort helper** (P1) — route the ~10
   `partial_cmp().unwrap()` sites (vindex router:107/lm_head:322/gate_store:330,
   core graph:278/walk:35/pagerank:19, cli parity:1119, python vindex:847,1432)
   and `larql-lql`'s four `embed.row()` callers through bounds-checked helpers.
   [larql-vindex, larql-core, larql-cli, larql-lql]
6. **SQL expert UTF-8 offset bug + typed cross-crate contracts** (P2) —
   `larql-experts/sql/src/lib.rs:161` slices the original string with offsets
   from an uppercased copy (panic on non-ASCII SQL); use `char_indices`. Then
   consider typing the `*const f32` reinterpret, positional-QKVO
   (`attn_data[1]/[2]`), and `per_layer_ffn_key` conventions to stop silent
   drift. `larql-router-protocol`: `None` fingerprint disables TLS verification.
   [larql-experts — no crate roadmap, larql-router-protocol — no crate roadmap]

Hygiene (separate from the sweep): 2 clippy nits in `larql-cli` (unused
`ProjectorWeights`, dead `total_tiles`); coverage below the ≥90% floor on
`larql-inference` (70.7%) and `larql-cli` (12.0%).

### Follow-up review (2026-06-12)

Diff review of the in-flight C10/FR3 changes + fresh whole-workspace sweep
(10 subsystem readers + adversarial verification; several headline claims
refuted — GGUF overflow, kernel release-mode bounds, `attn_fused` overflow
all died under verification). Full record:
[`docs/audits/codebase-review-2026-06-12.md`](docs/audits/codebase-review-2026-06-12.md).
Items 1 and 5 of the 2026-05-28 list were re-confirmed still open
(`cached.rs:123,200`/`hidden.rs:38` panics; python `vindex.rs:847` NaN sort)
— they stay tracked there, not duplicated here.

Ordered actions:

1. **Sanitize `model_id` in shard loader** (P0, security) —
   `larql-server/shard_loader.rs:30` joins router-supplied `model_id`
   (`announce.rs:544`) into the store path unvalidated; `../` escapes the
   shard dir (tar unpack itself is safe, tar 0.4.45). Reject path
   separators / `..`. Follow-on (P2): grid non-join RPCs (`drain_server`,
   `assign_range`, `grid/service.rs:114`) don't require the grid key.
   [larql-server, larql-router]
2. **Check Metal command-buffer status** (P0) — all 77
   `wait_until_completed()` sites read buffers with no `status()`/`error()`
   inspection (e.g. `ops/full_pipeline/dispatch.rs:456,783`); a failed GPU
   command yields stale data straight into logits. Add a `wait_and_check()`
   helper and migrate. Cheap insurance against the next phantom-drift hunt.
   [larql-compute-metal — no crate roadmap]
3. **Route the 2 hardcoded dispatches through `KernelHandle`** (P1, latent
   but a 3×-historical bug class) — `decode_hybrid.rs:388-391` hardcodes
   256 threads/TG while `q8_matvec_pipeline` is already a `KernelHandle`
   carrying the geometry; `stages/qkv_proj.rs:241` takes a raw
   `ComputePipelineState` so it can't consult one. Correct today, silently
   fast-but-wrong on any shader geometry change. [larql-compute-metal]
4. **Corrupt-vindex load robustness** (P1) — `larql-vindex
   format/load.rs:81,293` index `gate_slices[info.layer]` with
   `info.layer` straight from `index.json`, no bounds check (panic on
   corrupt manifest; validate `< num_layers` → `VindexError::Parse`);
   `load.rs:317` defaults missing manifest `offset`/`length` to 0,
   masking the real error. [larql-vindex]
5. **Validate Q4K lm_head buffer size** (P1, from the diff review) —
   `larql-kv/generation.rs:657` + `larql-inference
   forward/predict/dense.rs:189` never check buffer len vs
   `vocab_size × bytes_per_row`; truncated weights panic mid-decode,
   padded ones decode garbage logits. One length check → clean f32
   fallback. [larql-kv, larql-inference]
6. **Release the GIL in larql-python** (P1) — zero `allow_threads` in the
   crate; `predict`/`trace`/`generate_with_hooks`/`infer`/`infer_trace`
   block all Python threads for whole forward passes. Wrap compute in
   `py.allow_threads`. (NaN sort at `vindex.rs:847` already tracked as
   2026-05-28 item 5.) [larql-python — no crate roadmap]
7. **Env-flag registry** (P1) — 145 distinct `LARQL_*` flags, ~18
   documented; accepted values already diverge (`LARQL_Q4K_ASM=true` works,
   the three new C10 flags accept only `"1"` — a bench run with `=true`
   silently measures the wrong config). Route flags through the
   `larql-compute/src/options.rs` taxonomy + generate `docs/env-flags.md`.
   [workspace]
8. **Diff-review cleanups before/with the C10 commit** (P2) — fold
   `hidden == 0` into the padded-down guard (`larql-compute
   kquant_forward/cached.rs:861` + twin); extract the duplicated ~35-line
   padded-down block into one `larql-compute` helper with a reusable
   scratch buffer (kills the lockstep-comment hazard + ~69 KB/token alloc
   on 26B); drop the unnecessary `relations.clone()`
   (`larql-lql edges.rs:186`); length-check `labels`/`counts` at load
   (`relations.rs:35`); OnceLock the `LARQL_FR3_EXPLICIT` read
   (`edges.rs:279`). [larql-compute, larql-inference, larql-lql]
9. **Forward-pass loop unification** (P2, ADR first) — five parallel
   layer-step loops in `larql-inference/vindex/kquant_forward/`
   (`hidden`/`prefill`/`decode_step`/`decode_step_direct`/remote-FFN) each
   repeat the same sentinel logic; every stepping change lands 5× or
   numerics silently diverge. Big-ticket; cuts across the C10-hot files,
   so sequence behind the current residency arc. [larql-inference]
10. **Dead weight** (P2) — 4 unreferenced Metal shader modules
    (`graph_walk_knn`, `q4_sparse_matvec`, `turboquant_{encode,decode}`)
    need an ADR-017 retention rationale or deletion; `model-compute` crate
    has no second consumer (no-speculative-extraction policy); `larql-inference`
    `test_utils.rs` (1,228 lines) ships as public API. [larql-compute-metal,
    model-compute, larql-inference]
11. **Serving posture** (P2, plausible-not-verified) — document or fix:
    streaming completions serialize on the weights guard
    (`completions.rs:302`) with no per-request timeout (`:366`); no
    graceful drain on shutdown (`bootstrap.rs:1255`); grid join stream has
    no malformed-message rate limit (`grid/service.rs:121`). [larql-server,
    larql-router]

## Cleanup / consolidation track (added 2026-06-12)

Standing recommendations from the 2026-06-12 review, distinct from the
hardening bug-fixes above: this is the maintenance-debt layer. The repeated
observation across both reviews is that bugs in this codebase come back from
the dead through **duplication** — parallel paths created to avoid
destabilising a parity-verified one, then maintained in lockstep by comment
("keep in lockstep" twins, `KernelHandle` bypassed at 2 new sites, 6 copies
of the env-flag helper with diverging semantics). The corrective habit, made
policy:

> **Prefer a parameter on the existing path over a parallel path.** A new
> code path needs the same justification as a new crate: a reason the
> existing one cannot be parameterised. Opt-in experiment paths are fine,
> but they get a removal-or-promotion condition when added, not after.

Themes, in leverage order (concrete first steps live in hardening items
7–10 above; this section tracks the policy-level work):

1. **One forward-pass spine** — the five parallel layer-step loops in
   `larql-inference/vindex/kquant_forward/` are the canonical instance.
   ADR first (what is the shared layer-step contract: sentinels, MoE
   detection, KV dispatch, capture hooks), then fold
   `hidden`/`prefill`/`decode_step`/`decode_step_direct`/remote-FFN onto
   it. Sequenced behind the C10 residency arc (same hot files). The
   padded-down twin extraction (hardening item 8) is the cheap pilot for
   the same move one level down. [larql-inference, larql-compute]
2. **Flags → config** — beyond the registry (hardening item 7): any
   `LARQL_*` flag that changes numerics and has survived its experiment
   (e.g. the Q4K residency trio once C10 lands) gets promoted to real
   config/CLI surface or deleted; env vars stay for diagnostics and
   short-lived experiments only. Uniform parsing through the
   `options.rs` taxonomy so `=true` vs `=1` can never again silently
   change what a bench measured. [workspace]
3. **Experiment-path lifecycle** — opt-in paths that lost their A/B keep
   accumulating (ADR-017 covers shaders; nothing covers CPU/env paths).
   Extend the ADR-017 rule workspace-wide: every opt-in path carries a
   retention rationale + revival story, and reviews may delete any that
   lack one. Current deletions/decisions owed: 4 unreferenced Metal shader
   modules, `model-compute` (no second consumer), `larql-experts`
   integration status, `test_utils.rs` out of larql-inference's public
   API. [workspace]
4. **API surface honesty** — `larql-inference/vindex` re-exports ~28
   implementation-named functions (`predict_kquant_*` variants); external
   callers choose forward paths by fuzzy naming. After (1), expose one
   facade that dispatches internally; deprecate the variants. Pairs with
   the Engine/StatePolicy framing already proposed. [larql-inference]
5. **Coverage debt** — per-file ≥90% floor policy vs reality:
   `larql-inference` 70.7%, `larql-cli` 12.0% (snapshot 2026-05-16).
   Raise toward the floor opportunistically as files are touched by (1)
   and (4) rather than as a standalone sweep; new/split files land at
   ≥90% (existing policy). [larql-inference, larql-cli]
6. **Scratch-artifact hygiene** — underscore-prefixed bench baselines
   (`bench/baselines/_*.json`) are scratch by convention but accumulate
   untracked/half-tracked; adopt the rule that `_`-prefixed artifacts are
   gitignored, and reconciled baselines get real names + a RUNBOOK line.

## BitNet b1.58 integration hardening (added 2026-06-20)

Native-ternary BitNet (`microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T`) landed on
`feat/quant-ternary-a8`. The **W1.58·A8 kernel work in `larql-compute`
is the strongest part and fits the architecture cleanly**: ternary matvec
lives in `cpu/ops/ternary_matvec.rs` alongside the q4k/q6k kernels, follows
the `_into` allocation-free convention, and is parity-disciplined —
dequant-reference parity, **bit-exact NEON-vs-scalar across `cols % 16`
tails**, and shape-guard rejection tests. NEON gives ~12–13× the f32
reference on BitNet shapes; x86_64 has the scalar-A8 ~2.4× today.

The **system-level integration is a deliberate parallel stack** — a fresh
instance of the consolidation-track theme above (parallel path created to
avoid destabilising a parity-verified one). BitNet bypasses every shared
seam: `QuantFormat`/`FormatRoute` dispatch, the `KvEngine` trait,
`larql-kv::KvCache`, the models arch registry, and the vindex build
pipeline. This is documented as intentional pending the FormatRoute
roadmap and is a defensible MVP posture for a narrowly-scoped path. The
module comment that gated folding-in on "once the quantised-activation
kernel exists" now has its precondition met (this branch), so the
promotion-or-isolation decision the policy box demands is no longer
blocked — it is made explicit below (the G1–G4 structural items), with the
2026-06-20 hardening pass clearing the quick wins first.

Per-crate status:

- **`larql-compute`** — fits. Kernel + tests land in the right module with
  the right discipline. The earlier doc inaccuracy (header implied the path
  already routes through `FormatRoute`) is **reconciled**: `QuantFormat`
  (`pipeline.rs:25-34`) still has no ternary variant, `from_registry_tag`
  (`pipeline.rs:104-116`) maps no ternary tag, and the `QuantMatVec` dispatch
  trait has no ternary arm — `BitLinearWeight` is reachable only by direct
  call, and the docstring now says so plainly (dispatch integration is the
  open structural item, not done).
- **`larql-inference`** — bespoke parallel stack. `BitnetModel` is not a
  `KvEngine`; `BitnetKvCache` is a hand-rolled `Vec<Array2<f32>>` rather
  than `larql-kv::KvCache`, so none of the KV append-in-place / windowing /
  surgery work applies. Entry is direct (`load_bitnet_model` → `generate`),
  no unified dispatch picks between dense and ternary. (The hot path now
  quantises the shared activation once per Q/K/V and gate/up, and the header
  comment reflects the now-met kernel precondition — the structural
  KvEngine/shared-cache fold remains open.)
- **`larql-vindex`** — `bitnet_writer`/`bitnet_loader` write a `bitnet/`
  sidecar (`*.i2s` + `scales.f32` + `bitnet_layout.json`) and patch
  `index.json` with a `bitnet_layout` field, independent of the
  `quant: QuantFormat` enum field (two parallel quant-tag mechanisms).
  Writer is a post-build patch from `convert_cmd.rs`, not part of the build
  pipeline.
- **`larql-models`** — was the fragile seam; **FIXED 2026-06-20**.
  `"bitnet-*"` is now recognised explicitly in `detect/mod.rs` and routes to
  a thin named `BitnetArch` (`architectures/bitnet.rs`, `family() ==
  "bitnet"`, Llama-style defaults, `norm_eps` honoured from config) instead
  of silently collapsing to `GenericArch`. Native-ternary inference is still
  served by the `larql-inference` ternary path, not this trait; `BitnetArch`
  is the home for first-class overrides when BitNet graduates. Covered by
  `test_detect_bitnet_is_explicit_not_generic`.

### Completed — hardening pass (2026-06-20)

The quick-win review items landed; all touched crates build clean and
clippy-clean (`--all-targets`), tests green (compute ternary 19/19,
inference ternary 28/28 incl. the FFN A8-vs-f32 parity gate, models detect
59/59):

1. ✅ **[larql-models] Killed the silent `GenericArch` fallback** — explicit
   `bitnet-*` recognition → thin named `BitnetArch`; `norm_eps` honoured;
   `test_detect_bitnet_is_explicit_not_generic`. *(was P1)*
2. ✅ **[larql-compute] Reconciled the `ternary_matvec.rs` docstring** — no
   longer implies the path routes through `FormatRoute`; states that dispatch
   integration is the open item and the kernel is reached by direct call.
3. ✅ **[larql-inference] Reuse one activation quant** — Q/K/V and gate/up
   quantise the shared activation once (`quantize_activation_i8` +
   `matvec_i2s_a8_into`) across all five forward sites. Bit-exact (parity
   tests unchanged), saves the repeat int8 quantise per projection.
4. ✅ **[larql-inference] Refreshed the `ternary.rs` header comment** — the
   "fold in once the quant-activation kernel exists" precondition is now met;
   the comment frames the fold as live roadmap work, not a missing dependency.
5. ✅ **[larql-compute] x86_64 gap documented** — verified already clear at
   the dispatch entry (`matvec_i2s_a8_into`: "scalar int8 elsewhere — AVX2
   twin is the x86_64 follow-up") and the status block.

Owed back to the user (not a code change):

6. **[git hygiene] Split the `pipeline_layer.rs` refactor** — the
   `attn_str_to_format`/`ffn_str_to_format` → `from_registry_tag` dedup is a
   sound single-source-of-truth cleanup but is **orthogonal to BitNet**
   (BitNet never flows through `resolve_ffn_weights`). Land it as its own
   "refactor: dedupe tag→format mapping" commit, not inside the feature.

### Remaining — graduation to first-class (status 2026-06-20 after scoping)

Close contact with the code (two scoping passes) revised this list: only G1
was cleanly doable on the current machine. G2 and G4 hit genuine blockers and
G3's framing was falsified. Detail per item:

- **G1 — `QuantFormat` ternary variant + dispatch — ✅ DONE 2026-06-20.**
  Added `QuantFormat::I2S` (+ `registry_tag`/`from_registry_tag` round-trip,
  `is_ternary`), a dedicated `QuantMatVec::ternary_matvec` method (a
  `BitLinearWeight` carries the per-channel scales the `&[u8]` `quant_matvec`
  signature can't), and a `CpuBackend` impl on the best-available A8 kernel.
  `quant_matvec` returns `None` for I2S (loud, like Q8_0); Metal panics (no
  ternary shader). Registry-reachable now, not only by direct call. Tested +
  clippy-clean.
- **G2 — `KvEngine` impl + shared cache — BLOCKED on a breaking trait change
  (your call).** Scoping (kv_engine.rs / larql-kv) found `KvEngine::prefill`
  and `decode_step` are typed `(&ModelWeights, &dyn FfnBackend, …)` — dense
  f32 weights. `BitnetModel` holds ternary `BitLinearWeight`s, an incompatible
  container. Making BitNet a first-class `KvEngine` needs EITHER a
  workspace-wide generalisation of the weight parameter to a `dyn` trait (real
  breaking change, hot-path dyn dispatch — heavy for an example-only feature)
  OR a type-lie (accept `&ModelWeights`, ignore it, route to an owned
  `BitnetModel`) — rejected as exactly the parallel-path anti-pattern the
  policy box forbids. The cache-only sub-part (`BitnetKvCache` →
  `larql-kv::KvCache`) is shape-compatible but marginal (the shared cache
  doesn't append-in-place for this path either) and carries hot-path parity
  risk, and it does NOT reach "first-class". → Decision: take the breaking
  trait generalisation, or leave BitNet isolated-but-explicit (recommended
  until a second consumer exists).
- **G3 — vindex quant-tag unification — GOAL FALSIFIED; struck.** Scoping
  found BitNet vindexes are **mixed**: the dense scaffold (`embed`, `lm_head`,
  `output_norm`) is f32 and loaded by the standard loader with
  `skip_attn`/`skip_ffn`, while only attn/ffn are ternary. `quant:
  QuantFormat::None` is therefore *correct* for the dense loader — setting
  `quant: I2S` would mislead it into decoding the embedding as ternary. A
  single `quant` tag cannot represent a mixed model; the two-field design
  (`quant` for the dense scaffold + `bitnet_layout` manifest for the ternary
  tensors) is the right shape. The only survivor is a modest mechanical
  cleanup — move `bitnet_writer` from a `convert_cmd` read-modify-write
  post-patch into the build pipeline so `index.json` is written once — low
  payoff, invasive through the shared build path. Not pursued.
- **G4 — AVX2 `_mm256_sign_epi8` twin — BLOCKED on an x86 build/test box.**
  Design is clear (decode trit codes → a `{-1,0,+1}` int8 control, one
  `_mm256_sign_epi8(x, control)`, widen-accumulate; bit-identical to scalar).
  But this aarch64 machine can neither runtime-validate the SIMD NOR even
  compile-check it (cross-`check` fails in the C-FFI build script — no
  `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc`). Committing unbuilt, unvalidated intrinsics violates
  the parity discipline. → Defer to an x86 dev box / Linux CI runner, where
  the scalar-vs-AVX2 bit-exact test (already the pattern for the NEON twin)
  can gate it. x86_64 keeps the correct scalar-A8 path (~2.4×) meanwhile.

### Productization plan (decision: PRODUCTIZE, 2026-06-20)

Direction chosen: make BitNet a real served path, not a validated experiment.
Scoping fixed the magnitude — BitNet has **zero CLI/server hookup today**
(`load_bitnet_model` is called only from the example); the dense run path is
`layer_graph::generate_streaming` over the engine dispatch; `run_cmd::run()`
is a chain of early-return mode branches (experts / ffn / moe / image). Three
stages, smallest-blast first:

- **P-A — Serve BitNet from `larql run` (CLI) — ✅ BEHAVIOUR-VERIFIED
  2026-06-20.** `run_cmd::run()` branches on `config.bitnet_layout.is_some()`
  and drives `ternary::generate_streaming_bitnet` (greedy stream + chat REPL),
  bypassing the dense `walk_cmd` path. Smoke-tested against
  `~/larql-vindex/bitnet-2b.vindex`:
  `larql run <vindex> "The capital of France is" -n 16` →
  `" Paris. Paris is a city that is known for its rich history, culture,"` —
  deterministic across runs. **This greedy output is the P-B regression
  oracle** (saved local-only at `bench/oracles/bitnet_2b_capital_of_france.txt`;
  not committed — depends on the >1 GB vindex; repro = the command above).
  Bridges at the run layer; does NOT make BitNet a `KvEngine`.
  *Remaining (deferred to AFTER P-B, deliberately): server stream-route wiring
  + chat-template/sampling parity — wiring the server now would thread
  `&ModelWeights` through the hot path B1 is about to strip; wire once, after.*
- **P-B — First-class `KvEngine` (the structural refactor).** Blast radius
  measured: **8 production engine impls + ~171 `prefill`/`decode_step` call
  sites + `EngineKind`/`AnyEngine`**. The one-way-door is the trait shape;
  pick before the breaking change:
  - **B1 (CHOSEN 2026-06-20): engines own their weights.** Move `&ModelWeights`
    out of `prefill`/`decode_step` into engine construction (engines hold
    `Arc<ModelWeights>`); `BitnetEngine` holds `Arc<BitnetModel>`.
    **Read-only check (done):** dense `prefill`/`decode_step` and the
    `*_resident` path take `&ModelWeights` (read-only — B1-clean); BitNet
    weights are final (no mutation). BUT the **quant-resident path
    (`prefill_quant`/`decode_step_quant`) takes `&mut ModelWeights`** — it
    memoizes resident-quant buffers back into the struct. So B1 is NOT pure
    mechanical churn; it bundles one design sub-decision for that path:
    **(a)** relocate the resident-quant memoization out of `ModelWeights` into
    engine-owned derivative state (recommended — lands on the StatePolicy
    split: canonical weights immutable, derived caches are engine state), or
    **(b)** `Arc<ModelWeights>` + interior mutability (`OnceCell`/`RwLock`) on
    just the resident-quant fields (smaller, keeps derived state in the
    canonical struct). Cost = ~171 mechanical sites + this sub-decision.
  - **B2: `&dyn ModelSource` param.** New trait; `&ModelWeights` auto-coerces
    so most call sites are untouched, but the trait must mirror the slice of
    `ModelWeights` engines use, and BitNet panics on dense-only methods.
  - **B3: `ModelWeights` gains a ternary representation.** Smallest type diff
    but leaks ternary-awareness into the dense engines — rejected.
  Do P-B as its own PR after P-A proves the path; hold parity per the 7-spec
  `resident_identity_tests` discipline.

  **Grounded execution stages (B1a chosen, real-code scope 2026-06-20).** The
  `&mut` has a single chokepoint:
  `larql_inference::vindex::dequant::ensure_attn_tensors_dequantised(&mut weights, index)`
  (`vindex/dequant.rs:35`) — it dequantises Q4K Q/K/V/O into `weights.tensors`
  (a `HashMap`) keyed by `arch.attn_{q,k,v,o}_key(layer)`, idempotent, and the
  forward reads them back from that map. Pure derivative state. Stages, each
  compilable + checked against the captured greedy oracle:
  - **P-B.1 — relocate the dequant cache (HOME LOCKED: engine, not
    `ModelWeights`; concurrency evidence 2026-06-20).** Move the dequantised-
    attention `HashMap` out of `weights.tensors` into **engine-owned** state and
    consult it at the forward's tensor-read sites (resolver: engine cache →
    canonical weights). Drops the `&mut` from `prefill_quant`/`decode_step_quant`.
    *Why engine, not an interior-mutable `RwLock` field on `ModelWeights`:* the
    scratch is **transient** (per-layer evicted for the memory bound) → per-
    forward state, not a persistent cache. The server holds one
    `weights: OnceLock<RwLock<ModelWeights>>` and **serializes every generation
    behind an exclusive write lock** (`state.rs:186 lock_weights_for_gen`,
    used by all OpenAI gen routes) *specifically because* this dequant mutation
    makes weights non-immutable ("concurrent reads block while a generation is
    in flight"). An interior-mut `RwLock` field can't lift that — two forwards
    sharing one `Arc` would clobber each other's evicting scratch, so gen would
    still have to serialize (and the dense 117 tok/s path would pay a per-resolve
    read-lock + `ArcArray` clone for a scratch that's always empty for it).
    Engine-owned scratch makes `ModelWeights` **truly immutable** →
    `Arc<ModelWeights>` shared across **concurrent** generations, each engine
    its own cache (no lock, no race, no tax) — the actual payoff of the refactor.
    Resolver threads as `&mut self.dequant_cache` from the engine (it's already
    the `&mut self` forward context). Touches the Q4K residency path —
    `resident_identity_tests` + the oracle guard it. *(A provisional
    `RwLock`-in-`ModelWeights` impl was tried this session and reverted on this
    evidence before the read-site/trait sweep could cement it.)*

    **P-B.1 status (2026-06-20): signature stages DONE+committed, relocation
    set up + reverted-to-green.** Done behavior-identical: `WeightsView`/
    `DequantScratch` foundation; **Stage 1** (`run_attention_with_kv_backend` →
    `WeightsView`, ~22 `dense()` wraps); **Stage 2a** (`dense_ffn_forward` →
    `WeightsView`, `WeightFfn`/`BackendFfn` wrap `dense()` internally so the 326
    `WeightFfn` construction sites stay untouched). The workspace-spanning
    cross-crate signature diff is banked, decoupled from any behavior change,
    each proven byte-identical by parity tests.

    **Stage 2b (the relocation, behavior-changing) was reverted, and the reason
    is categorical, not cost.** The first four blast-radius escalations
    (RwLock→engine, cross-crate, 326-`WeightFfn`, decode reader) were all
    *compiler-visible*: change a signature, the compiler enumerates callers. The
    fifth is *type-system-invisible* — a reader that resolves `weights.tensors`
    via `Deref` (canonical) while the scratch sits in an unconsulted
    `DequantScratch` compiles clean, runs, and is wrong **only on the decode
    path under a real Q4K vindex**. Holding that on a red tree across a session
    boundary strands a miscompilation `cargo check` can't recover, so revert to
    Stage 2a green was the only correctness-preserving move.

    **Silent-break closure = make the miss LOUD, not enumerate readers.** The
    grep inventory (`tensors.get(&arch.attn_*/ffn_*`) is *current, not complete*
    — blind to precomputed-key reads, prefix iteration, accessor methods that
    `.get` internally. The design fix: for a quant model those dequant keys were
    **never** in canonical `tensors` (they only ever existed as the forward-time
    mutation target being relocated), so if the relocation inserts only into
    scratch and leaves canonical untouched, a missed reader resolves `None` →
    the existing `.unwrap_or_else(panic)` / `?`-bail fires on first decode, on
    any vindex. **Design property to enforce: leave canonical genuinely empty of
    dequant keys (not shadowed)** → misses are loud by construction. Grep scopes
    the conversion; the runtime catches its misses.

    **Stage 2b entry conditions (all met — no upstream gap this time):**
    (1) a Q4K vindex — **`~/larql-vindex/qwen3-0.6b-q4k.vindex` exists**;
    (2) a **multi-token DECODE** oracle captured at Stage 2a (NOT prefill-only /
    single-token — the decode reader is exactly the one Stage 1 missed, so a
    prefill-heavy capture has a blind spot the shape of the bug); byte-identical
    decode vs Stage 2a is the regression spine; (3) the canonical-empty shaping
    above. With these, the reader conversion is mechanical and the silent-break
    class is closed by construction.

    **Stage 2b progress + the reader-family finding (2026-06-20).** Done +
    committed behavior-identical: all THREE "primary" quant-path readers now
    take `WeightsView` — `run_attention_with_kv_backend` (Stage 1),
    `dense_ffn_forward` (Stage 2a), `run_attention_block_decode_step_backend`
    (Stage 2b-pre). The Q4K **decode** oracle is captured
    (`bench/oracles/q4k_qwen3_history_of_computing.txt`, 24-token greedy on
    `qwen3-0.6b-q4k.vindex`). The relocation proper (inserters→scratch,
    `ViewFfn`, wire the cached prefill+decode loops, drop `&mut`) was drafted
    and reverted to green when the **secondary** loops (`hidden.rs`,
    `interventions.rs`) surfaced that the reader set is *still* expanding on
    contact: they reach attention through `run_layer_with_ffn` →
    `run_attention_inner` / `run_attention_with_kv_cache` →
    `run_attention_block_core` (block.rs) + `run_attention_block_gpu` (gpu.rs)
    — **un-converted readers the grep never surfaced**, exactly the
    "current-not-complete" inventory. So the true relocation scope is "convert
    the **whole attention-reader family**" (with_kv_backend✓ / decode✓ /
    block_core / block_gpu / inner / with_kv_cache), each a Stage-1-style
    cascade through a widely-used fn — several more passes, not one. The cached
    decode path (the oracle path) wired cleanly; the secondary loops need the
    rest of the family first. **Loud-break makes this safe to do incrementally**
    (canonical empty of dequant keys → a missed reader gets `None` → the
    existing `.unwrap_or_else(panic)` fires on first decode, loud not silent),
    so each remaining reader can be converted + the loop wired + validated
    against the oracle without a silent miscompilation risk.

    **✅ DONE (2026-06-20, `9650582e` + `f0da87cc`).** The whole-family
    conversion + the relocation both landed. (1) `9650582e` converted the
    entire attention-reader family to `WeightsView` — `block_core`, `block_gpu`,
    `run_attention_inner`, `run_attention_with_kv_cache`, `run_layer_with_ffn`,
    `run_layer_with_capture[_hooked]`, `run_attention_public` + the block.rs
    family — ~100 callers `dense()`-wrapped across compute/inference/kv/cli/
    server/examples, behavior-identical (the compiler enumerated the family for
    me; the cascade bottoming out *is* the proof the inventory is now complete).
    (2) `f0da87cc` did the relocation: the production decode path
    (`predict_kquant_prefill/decode_step` + `hidden` + `interventions`)
    dequantises into a forward-local `DequantScratch` resolved via
    `WeightsView::with_scratch` + `ViewFfn` — **`weights` is `&ModelWeights`
    (immutable, Arc-able) on the decode path, `&mut` dropped.** Bulk
    f32-fallback + dev drivers (KvEngine `*_quant` trait defaults, all larql-kv
    quant-engine overrides, apollo, ov_rd CLI, the lql relation resolver, the
    vision/image CLI, examples) keep in-`weights` behaviour via `*_resident`
    shims (dequant → scratch → merge into `weights.tensors`). Validated:
    workspace `--all-targets` green, clippy 0 warnings, 50 kquant + 13 dequant +
    resident_identity tests pass, decode **byte-identical to the oracle** both
    after the family conversion and after the relocation. **Follow-up:** the
    `*_resident` bulk path is still `&mut` — dropping it needs engine-owned
    scratch state (folds into P-B.2/P-B.3, not a blocker); loud-break guards it.

    **P-B.1b — "no shims" full sweep (scoped 2026-06-20; WIP stashed).** Going
    for zero `weights.tensors.extend` shims surfaced a **second `kquant_forward`
    implementation**: the production `larql run` decode dispatches via KvEngines
    → `coarse_prefill` → **larql-compute's** `kquant_forward` (1005 lines), NOT
    the larql-inference copy (1772 lines) that P-B.1 relocated. The
    larql-inference copy serves the direct-`predict_kquant`/AVE/hidden paths and
    is validated by the 50 kquant unit tests; **the e2e oracle actually
    exercises larql-compute's copy** (so the family conversion — shared
    `run_attention_*` — was oracle-validated, but the larql-inference relocation
    was unit-test-validated, not oracle). The full no-shim change is large and
    interconnected:
    (1) relocate **larql-compute's** `kquant_forward` too (cached/decode loops →
        forward-local scratch + `ViewFfn`) — DONE in the stash, the real oracle
        path now no-shim;
    (2) `KvDispatch` (5 methods) + the 7 dispatch helpers + `AsyncComputeBackend`
        + cpu/metal impls → `WeightsView` — DONE in the stash;
    (3) coarse path (`coarse_prefill`/`coarse_decode_step`) drops `&mut` (delegates
        to the now-`&` `predict_kquant_*`) — DONE;
    (4) `KvEngine`/`RetrievalEngine` trait quant methods → `&ModelWeights`;
        `RetrievalEngine::prefill_quant` default → loud error (apollo overrides;
        the `ffn`-less `prefill` can't thread a scratch) — DONE;
    (5) **engine-scratch design** (validated on `StandardEngine`): each engine
        owns a `dequant_scratch: DequantScratch`; `do_prefill`/`do_decode_step`
        build `WeightsView::with_scratch(weights, &self.dequant_scratch)` — the
        view borrows `self.dequant_scratch` while `self.handles`/`self.backend`
        are borrowed disjointly, so **no take/restore dance**; `prefill_quant`
        dequants into the field, no merge. StandardEngine compiles clean.
    Remaining (the stash is mid-sweep, ~29 errors): the **other 7 engines**
    (no_cache, boundary×2, markov×2, turbo, unlimited, apollo) each need the
    same field + view-thread + `&mut`-drop, plus their forward helpers
    (`kv_prefill_run` + the `generate_cached_*` loops in larql-kv/generation.rs,
    apollo's `forward_raw_logits`) converted to `WeightsView`, then the dev
    drivers (ov_rd/lql/vision/examples) + delete the `*_resident` shims. The
    pattern is mechanical but keeps surfacing forward helpers on contact (the
    reader-family expansion, now in the engine layer) — a focused dedicated pass.
    `git stash list` → "no-shims WIP".

    **Convergence measurement (2026-06-21).** Resumed the sweep and pushed into
    the engines. Additional shared decode/recompute readers converted to
    `WeightsView` (these are real foundation, beyond the StandardEngine work):
    `run_attention_block_decode_step_auto` + `_auto_inplace` (the resident-decode
    switcher used by **5 engines** — q4k-direct branch reads native index bytes
    via `.canonical()`, f32 branch threads the view), `kv_prefill_run`
    (no_cache + standard), `recompute_kv` + `attn_kv_projection_weights`
    (boundary + markov), and **NoCacheEngine** fully (field + view-thread +
    `&mut` drop, clean). **But the larql-kv error count DIVERGED as I converted:
    28 → 45 → 67.** Each engine's `walk.rs`/`compute.rs` forward module is a deep
    chain (engine → walk → recompute → projection → `weights.tensors`), and
    converting one helper exposes its callers + their internal reads. This is the
    reader-family expansion at its widest — **converting every engine's full
    forward/recompute internals** (~30-50+ functions across 6 engine modules +
    apollo's `forward_raw_logits` + the dev drivers). The diverging count is the
    decision signal: this is a **staged multi-session refactor**, best done one
    engine module at a time (convert its walk+compute internals, validate that
    engine against a per-engine oracle, commit), not a single grind. The shared
    helpers above are the foundation already laid; the per-engine internals are
    the remaining bulk. WIP re-stashed.

    **✅ DONE (2026-06-21, `379885ed`).** The diverging count (28→45→67)
    **converged to 0** as each engine module got the same template — the
    "diverging" was the compiler enumerating the work, not the work being
    unbounded. Every KvEngine (standard, no_cache, markov_residual,
    markov_residual_codec, boundary_per_layer, boundary_kv, turbo_quant,
    unlimited_context, apollo) now owns a `dequant_scratch` field; quant methods
    dequant into it and the forward resolves through `WeightsView::with_scratch`
    — **0 `&mut ModelWeights` quant methods, 0 `weights.tensors.extend` merges on
    the engine/serving path.** Per-engine pattern: bulk-convert the engine's
    `walk.rs`/`compute.rs`/`executor.rs`/`cold_tier.rs`/`dispatch.rs` to
    `WeightsView` (canonical reads — `embed`/`run_ffn`/`layer_ffn_or_moe`/
    `BackendFfn`/`WalkFfn`/native-q4k — via `.canonical()`/`&weights`; attn reads
    via the view), then the engine adds the field + threads `with_scratch` to its
    forward calls + drops `&mut`. Also converted: `LayerExecutor` trait +
    local_walk, `recompute_kv` + `attn_kv_projection_weights` (explicit lifetime),
    `auto`/`auto_inplace` (5 engines), `kv_prefill_run`, `forward_raw_logits`/
    `forward_from_layer` + raw.rs internals (`ViewFfn`; `hidden_to_raw_logits`/
    `apply_logits_transform` stay `&ModelWeights` = lm_head canonical). The
    `*_resident` helpers (`ensure_attn_..._resident` etc.) deliberately **remain**
    for ~58 dev/research call sites (ov_rd CLI, lql resolver, vision CLI,
    examples) that own a `&mut ModelWeights` and run one-off forwards against
    canonical `weights.tensors` — a documented separate API, not serving-path
    shims. Validated: workspace `--all-targets` green, clippy 0, **766 larql-kv +
    40 kquant + resident_identity + 4 dispatch_parity (cross-engine bit-parity)**
    tests pass, decode **byte-identical to the oracle**, and
    markov-rs/unlimited/turbo-quant/no-cache smoke-tested coherent at runtime.
    **Engine/serving path is now fully `&ModelWeights` — P-B.2 (Arc-owned) is
    unblocked with no remaining `&mut` to chase in the engines.**
  - **P-B.2 — Arc-owned weights.** Every weight param is now `&ModelWeights`;
    move it into engine construction (engines hold `Arc<ModelWeights>`) and drop
    the param from prefill/decode/quant/resident/executor variants. ~171 call
    sites (all production, 0 in test files) + `EngineKind`/`AnyEngine`.
    Compiler-driven — the safe kind of large churn.
  - **P-B.3 — `BitnetEngine` + dispatch.** New engine holding
    `Arc<BitnetModel>`, `impl KvEngine` over the ternary forward; add the
    `EngineKind`/`AnyEngine` arm so unified dispatch picks ternary vs dense.
  - **P-B.4 — validate** against the oracle (greedy "Paris…" byte-identical) +
    the engine parity suite.
  Best run in an isolated worktree so `main` stays stable through the change.
- **P-C — G4 AVX2 + x86 CI.** Add a Linux-x86 CI job; land the AVX2 twin gated
  by the scalar-vs-AVX2 bit-exact test (the NEON-twin pattern). Independent of
  P-A/P-B; unblocks G4's environment blocker.

## Demo narrative

### Act 1 — "The model is the database"
Run Gemma 3 4B or 4 26B locally. The vindex is the model; `larql run` queries it.
Show: latency, footprint, `larql walk` tracing a fact through layers.

**Status**: Works end-to-end. Needs chat-template + EOS fix so it doesn't loop.

### Act 2 — "The experts live elsewhere" (reframed per ADR-019)
**Original framing** (multi-machine grid for 671B-class MoE): demoted to P2.
The "elsewhere" was always a stretch for a substrate, and multi-machine
production-engineering doesn't accelerate any current experiment.

**Reframed**: single-machine expert dispatch on Gemma 4 26B-A4B. The shipped
gRPC grid (1-shard local) demonstrates expert routing; the demo can show
expert-by-expert activation tracing on one box, which is closer to the
substrate story (mechanism transparency) than to the production-engine
story (distributed inference). Replace "experts live elsewhere" framing
with "experts are addressable" framing.

**Status**: Server-side grid works (single-machine). Multi-machine items
(critical-path 5–10, RemoteExpertBackend, `/v1/expert/*`, reliability)
are P2 per ADR-019.

### Act 3 — "Replace an expert"
Swap expert 42 at layer 18 for a custom one. Observe the model's behaviour change.

**Status**: Works on single-machine via VID4-style approach (already
shipped publicly as VID4). Unaffected by ADR-019.

### Act 4 — "I killed attention" (future, video VID7)
Profile attention heads on a static template. Show 91% of heads produce
identical outputs across entity substitutions. Replace those with cached
lookups; remaining 9% run normally. Same outputs, fewer matmuls.

**Status**: Sketched in chat, not drafted. Gated on KU1 (static fraction at
31B-scale) and MTP6 (acceptance-rate evidence). See Video pipeline above.

## P0 — Mechanistic surface (lazarus parity)

Driver: replace the chuk-mlx engine in `chuk-mcp-lazarus` with larql. Lazarus
exposes ~77 inference-time MCP tools (capture, ablate, patch, steer, probe,
DLA, KV-surgery). Larql is currently strong on weight-level edits (MEMIT, KNN,
LQL) and weak on inference-time inspection/intervention. The 77 tools collapse
to one missing primitive: a **programmatic forward-hook system**. Once that
lands the rest is mostly Python wrappers.

evidence-grade traces and causal operators over the actual vindex-backed
inference path.

mechanism at a time.

## P1 — Research stack promotion: OV/RD → engine primitives

interpretability stacks by promoting reusable experiment plumbing into
stable engine APIs, while leaving fast-moving hypotheses in
`larql dev ov-rd` and Python artifact analysis.

| **R6** | **Promote depth-fraction-law probe API into a stable engine primitive: `Model::probe_at_depth_fraction(f) -> Probe`. Probe consumes residual at the requested fractional depth (15% / 25% / 38% verified on Gemma/Llama/Mistral) and returns a 32-dim PCA + logistic regression classifier output. Single API consumed by MTP3 (drafter activation extraction), virtual-expert dispatch (Act 3 demo), and grammar-mask routing.** | **larql-inference + larql-models** | **planned — MUST land before MTP3 begins (MTP3's layer-choice validation depends on R6)** |

Rule of thumb: engine code owns reusable capture/intervention/runtime
primitives; `ov_rd` owns experiment orchestration, PQ variants, address
probes, and report schemas until a runtime contract survives repeated
experiments.

**R6 rationale (added 2026-05-09)**: depth-fraction probes have been
validated across three architectures with a 32-dim PCA + logistic
regression at 0.3% inference-time overhead. They currently live in
`larql dev ov-rd` as experiment code. Three downstream items implicitly
need this API: MTP3's drafter-input extraction layer choice, the Act 3
expert-swap demo's routing decision, and grammar-mask construction for
constrained generation. Promoting once removes duplicate implementations
in three places.

**Sequencing (added 2026-05-09)**: R6 must land **before** MTP3 begins.
MTP3 explicitly depends on R6 for layer-choice validation ("if R6 says
discriminative information matures at 0.85·N, there is potentially free
quality improvement available"). Without R6, MTP3 ships with Google's
default layer choice and the validation has to be redone after R6 lands —
duplicate work. Insert R6 between MTP2 and MTP3 in the implementation
order.

## P1 — Grid transport, self-balancing & benchmarking

Driver: minimum latency across on-device/LAN/WAN; elastic scaling without
manual shard pre-loading; reproducible, architecture-agnostic performance
evidence. All work is model-family-neutral — no hardcoded layer counts,
hidden sizes, or architecture assumptions.

Spec: ADR-0009 (wire format), ADR-0010 (QUIC), ADR-0011 (self-balancing),
ADR-0012 (benchmarking).

## P0 — Interpretability truthfulness + commit semantics

Driver: make the current edit model honest before the demo, then earn the
stronger "INSERT commits into weights" story. Today default `INSERT MODE KNN`
is a retrieval overlay persisted in `knn_store.bin`; `COMPILE INTO VINDEX`
bakes compose/MEMIT overlays but carries that KNN sidecar forward. That is a
snapshot/package operation, not a mechanical commit of the journal into FFN
features.

Acceptance target for materialization:

```text
INFER(session_with_knn, q) == INFER(materialized_vindex, q)
```

for affected canonical prompts, plus a stronger trace/generalization check:
session trace reports pending retrieval; materialized trace shows residual/FFN
evidence; nearby unstored prompts behave through the materialized edit rather
than through a lookup sidecar.

Until C1-C3 ship, video language should distinguish three mechanisms:
KNN journal/retrieval overlay, compose FFN overlay, and compiled/baked weights.

## P1 — Model architecture independence hardening

Driver: keep LARQL from becoming "Gemma-shaped with exceptions." The core
`ModelArchitecture` trait is the right boundary, but several production paths
still infer family from strings, pass scalar attention geometry through
per-layer pipelines, or advertise architectures whose extraction/inference
contracts are incomplete.

| AI3 | Remove scalar attention-geometry fallbacks from backend decode APIs; allocate KV/cache/scratch from `FullPipelineLayer` per-layer shapes everywhere                                  | larql-compute + larql-inference               | planned |

Acceptance target: adding a new transformer architecture should require changes
inside `larql-models::architectures/*` and explicit capability decisions at
storage/forward boundaries, not incidental string matches or hidden Gemma/Llama
defaults in extraction and decode.

## Critical path (P0 — what blocks the demo)

Items in order. Each depends on the one above it. Truly P0 only — items
that were #5–#10 in the previous version (multi-machine grid) demoted
to P2 per ADR-019 (2026-05-09); see new section "P2 — Multi-machine MoE
grid" below for the demoted items.

Items 1–2 are needed for Act 1. Item 3's MoE performance gate landed
2026-05-02. Item 4 = C1 (CPU MoE forward pass) in the CPU-track section.

## P2 — Multi-machine MoE grid (deferred per ADR-019)

The items below were critical-path #5–#10 before ADR-019 (resolved
2026-05-09). They build the multi-machine MoE grid for "model spans
multiple consumer machines." Demoted because they are
production-engineering work with no current experiment requiring
multi-machine expert dispatch — single-machine sharding (already
shipped) covers all current substrate needs.

**Re-promotion conditions** (any one triggers re-promotion to P0):
1. A specific experiment requires multi-machine expert dispatch.
2. A frontier model release (671B-class or larger) becomes substrate-relevant.
3. The Ultimate acceptance tier in "P0 — CPU path to blazing" becomes a near-term goal rather than a stretch.

## P0 — Aim-validation tests (V1–V4)

Driver: the achievability analysis (see "Engine purpose" above) rests on
**four** load-bearing assumptions (three isolated + one compound). ADR-015
says isolated wins don't always compose — and D-RMS-FUSE Phase 1 (2026-05-09)
gave us a concrete falsification: predicted ~0.2 ms/tok savings collapsed to
zero. So we already have one data point that compounds *don't* always
materialise. The framing itself needs falsification tests before committing
years of engineering. Until V1–V4 land, the medium/long/ultimate acceptance
tiers in "P0 — CPU path to blazing" are aspirational, not engineering-targets.
**These are the highest-leverage items on the entire roadmap right now**:
each is relatively cheap (days to ~2 weeks) and each can collapse a large
downstream investment.

**Important framing**: V1, V2, and V4 are **extensions of work that's

**Interpretation rule**: V1, V2, V3 each collapse a tier of the
acceptance ladder if they fail.

- V1 fails (hash routing doesn't compound across layers, or output diverges
  too much) → medium-term and below acceptance shrinks; ultimate aim
  needs different sparsity mechanism.
- V2 fails (FP4 needs QAT for non-Gemma archs) → still workable but FP4
  becomes a per-model retraining concern, not a free 2×; multiplies
  long-term build cost.
- V3 fails (mmap'd vindex thrashes) → ultimate aim shrinks to
  "models that fit in RAM"; rules out 671B on 64 GB consumer.
- V4 fails (techniques don't compound) → re-derive the achievable
  envelope from measurement, not from the multiplicative product;
  re-tier confidence accordingly. Note D-RMS-FUSE has already given us
  one such data point at the small-magnitude end; V4 measures the
  large-magnitude case.

**Sequencing**: V1 and V2 are independent and cheap — run in parallel.
V3 takes longer and depends on V1 (hash routing creates the sparse
access pattern V3 measures). V4 runs once V1–V3 are done.

**Output artifact**: `experiments/V1-V4_aim_validation/` directory with
results, plus an updated "Achievability" subsection in this roadmap
with measured numbers replacing predicted ones, plus a memory entry per
test (per the user's falsification-log convention).

**This is the work to do next.** Everything else in the long-term roadmap
either gates on these tests or is engineering on assumptions these tests
verify.

## P0 — Engine ↔ Backend unification (specs landed 2026-05-16)

Driver: today's `KvEngine` (in `larql-kv`) and `ComputeBackend` (in
`larql-compute`) are unaware of each other. The four research KV engines
(MarkovRS, UnlimitedContext, TurboQuant, Apollo) live in research-only
bench paths; the production decode loop bypasses them. And every backend
(CPU, Metal, future Vulkan/CUDA) hides under a single trait that doesn't
let engines express *intents* (windowed attention, K/V recompute,
boundary upload) — only flat compute primitives (matmul, softmax). The
net effect: engine-aware kernel fusion, compute-aware engine selection,
and per-engine prefill graphs are all foreclosed today.

Three landed specs in `crates/larql-inference/docs/specs/`:

- [`kv-engine-unification.md`](crates/larql-inference/docs/specs/kv-engine-unification.md)
  — KvEngine trait + dispatch in `larql-inference`; `larql-kv` ships
  six engines (`Standard`, `NoCache`, `MarkovResidual`,
  `UnlimitedContext`, `TurboQuant`, `Apollo`).
- [`compute-backend-redesign.md`](crates/larql-inference/docs/specs/compute-backend-redesign.md)
  — `KvDispatch` sibling trait in `larql-inference` (intent-based
  per-layer surface); `EngineBackend: ComputeBackend + KvDispatch`
  umbrella; engines hold `Box<dyn EngineBackend>`.
- [`async-compute-backend.md`](crates/larql-inference/docs/specs/async-compute-backend.md)
  — `AsyncComputeBackend: ComputeBackend + KvDispatch` sibling trait
  (deferred dispatch / intent-collector / handle-based). Required for
  any GPU performance at per-layer intent granularity. Trait surface
  locked; implementation pending.

Honest scope: the unification PR is shippable today. The tok/s wins
require the multi-month AsyncComputeBackend implementation (Steps A1–A8
in the spec). Expect 6–12 months end-to-end before per-layer Metal
beats today's fused `decode_token` path.

Remaining engines' A5 slices (`MarkovResidual`, `UnlimitedContext`, `TurboQuant`, `NoCache`, `Apollo`) compose on the same pattern (~1–2 weeks each).                                                                                                                                   |

Result: ~0.4 tok/s vs `StandardEngine`'s 27.6 tok/s on the same hardware. Each engine has legitimate specialisation (RsStore residuals, per-window K/V checkpoints, WHT+Lloyd-Max codec, boundary residual injection) — the migration keeps that engine-side logic but routes the per-layer matvec through `larql_compute::QuantMatVec::q4k_matvec` instead of dequant-then-f32.

**Implementation order**: U1 ✅ → U2 ✅ → U3 ✅ → U4 (A1–A3 + A5
StandardEngine slice ✅; A4 real Metal deferred dispatch next; A5
remaining engines compose on the same pattern) → U5 (highest tok/s
leverage, run continuously alongside U6/U7) → **U9 → U10 → U11 → U12
(engine-layer de-Metal-ing — compute-refactor branch)** → U6 → U7. U4's
A4 is the next critical-path commitment; until it lands, U5/U6/U7 are
blocked. U9-U12 close the residual "Metal-as-GPU" coupling in
`larql-inference` so U6 (Vulkan) and U7 (CUDA) land as pure sibling
crates without inference-side cfg explosion.

**Acceptance**:
1. **Short-term** (U4 lands): engines that opt into async on Metal see
   decode at ≥ today's fused-path tok/s (1 GPU sync per token, matched
   cadence). No regression on default `StandardEngine` user-visible
   behaviour.
2. **Medium-term** (U5 lands `attention_step_windowed`): `standard:window=N`
   decode at ≥ 1.5× today's `standard` Metal decode on Gemma 3 4B at
   window=512. Per-shader bench artifact in `bench/baselines/cpu/` (or
   `metal/` once we add it).
3. **Long-term** (U5 covers `apollo` + `markov-rs`): long-context
   workloads where Apollo's compressed path applies decode at ≥ 8×
   today's Metal `standard` on Gemma 3 4B at 32k context. Requires
   offline boundary-store preprocessing — separate work item.
4. **Ultimate** (U6 + U7): same engine catalog runs on Vulkan
   (consumer NVIDIA/AMD/Intel GPUs without Apple Silicon) and CUDA
   (datacenter NVIDIA) with the same per-engine perf cliffs.

## P0 — CPU path to blazing (the ultimate-aim track)

Driver: the ultimate aim ("largest models at blazing speed on consumer
hardware, ideally without GPU") demands a permanent CPU track in
parallel with the GPU competitive-baseline track. CPU work is built
**in addition to** Metal work, not instead of it. Every item here is
either device-agnostic by construction (sparse retrieval) or has a
matched GPU twin (so the technique stack stays portable).

The bandwidth math is the gating constraint: 50 GB/s consumer DDR5
means a 671B Q4 model is 6.7 sec/token under naïve dense matmul.
Combined sparse-retrieval techniques (hash routing 5× × FP4 2× × KV
compression 10× = ~100×) make this ~134 ms/token — the actual
"blazing on consumer hardware" target. **(Revised 2026-05-31: hash-routing 5×
FALSIFIED by V1 — doesn't compound; FP4 2× confirmed by V2. The realistic

Reconciled like-for-like (M3 Max, t=8, warm): **larql 23.5 legacy / 26.4 StandardEngine vs llama.cpp 43.0 → 1.6–1.8×.** Gap is C12 (both attn AND FFN already use the int8 Q8_K SDOT kernel via `attention_decode_step_native`). **Free wins landed (2026-06-02):** `larql bench --cpu` now also reports the production StandardEngine row; new `--ollama-cpu` forces `num_gpu=0`+`num_thread` so `--ollama` is a true CPU baseline (was silently Metal-GPU).

Medium-term tier 62%→70% per the gate rule. Method addition: **pmset AC check + cross-engine drift bracket are now mandatory** — the first session was invalidated by a silent battery drain (llama.cpp itself collapsed 34→1 tok/s at 31% battery; far beyond the 1.5–3× thermal class). | CPU-track baseline-credibility threshold can't be enforced without this.

The 38 tok/s asymptote (FFN-alone) sets the floor any engine can reach on the current kernel — Standard and UnlimitedContext both hit 26.6 tok/s on Gemma 3 4B Q4K CPU (8-thread, 40-token prompt, 64 decode tokens) because both route through the same `attention_decode_step_native` + `ffn_decode_step_native` hot paths. Phases: (1) hand-asm Q4K matvec on the FFN tile shapes (gate/up/down) — closes ~95% of the gap, 1-2 weeks; (2) pre-formatted block layout — 1.1-1.2× on top, 3-5 days; (3) Q6K kernel for `ffn_down` — 1.05×, 2-3 days; (4) reduce rayon launch overhead — 1.04×, 2-3 days. Acceptance: ≥9.5 tok/s single-core, ≥39 tok/s 8-thread on Gemma 3 4B Q4K. Spec: [`crates/larql-compute/docs/q4k-decode-kernel.md`](crates/larql-compute/docs/q4k-decode-kernel.md). Per-stage measurement protocol: see "C12 per-stage measurement" below. |

**Implementation order** (post ADR-019): C10 → C1 → C2 → C7 → C12 → C3 → C4 → C5 → C6 → C8 → C11.

(C12 — Q4K decode kernel — slots in mid-sequence: after the dispatch trait is stable and StandardEngine is matching the legacy `larql-cpu` path through it (both now true), the hand-asm kernel is the next high-leverage CPU performance win. Single-threaded gain ~1.73× from a focused 1-2 week effort, scaling cleanly to ~1.7× at 8 threads.)
(C9 dropped from P0 sequence per ADR-019; re-add only if re-promoted.)

C10 first because the threshold can't be enforced without measurement.
C1+C2+C7 give you a working CPU decode path with bearable long-context.
C3+C4+C5 are the bandwidth-shrinking techniques that make the ultimate
aim possible. C6 squeezes the compute that remains. C8 unblocks
long-context. C11 prevents architectural drift.

**Acceptance**:
1. **Short-term** (C10 + C1 + C2): CPU Gemma 3 4B Q4_K decode within 10% of `llama.cpp -ngl 0` on M3 Max CPU.
2. **Medium-term** (+C3 + C4 + C7): CPU Gemma 3 4B FP4 + hash-routed decode at ≥2× the dense Q4_K CPU baseline.
3. **Long-term** (+C5 + C8): Gemma 4 26B-A4B (or larger) decode on a single 64GB consumer machine at ≥10 tok/s, no GPU.
4. **Ultimate** (full stack + frontier model): 100B-class model on consumer hardware at ≥5 tok/s, no GPU. Stretch goal: 671B-class via multi-machine grid (gated on re-promoting C9 per ADR-019).

### C12 per-stage measurement

Two instruments measure the kernel-bound nature of CPU decode and let you isolate which sub-kernel the asm should target first:

- `LARQL_INSTRUMENT_UNLIMITED=1` — prints `embed / attention / ffn` per `extend_q4k` call from `larql_kv::engines::unlimited_context::rs_extend_from_checkpoint_q4k`. Captures the per-token, per-layer-aggregated breakdown. Source: `crates/larql-kv/src/engines/unlimited_context/extend.rs`.
- `LARQL_INSTRUMENT_MARKOV=1` — same shape for `markov-residual`, kept for cross-engine sanity that both substrate paths agree. Source: `crates/larql-kv/src/engines/markov_residual/q4k.rs`.

Reproducer (Gemma 3 4B Q4K, M3 Max, default 8 threads):

```
cargo build --release -p larql-cli
LARQL_INSTRUMENT_UNLIMITED=1 ./target/release/larql bench \
  ~/.cache/larql/local/gemma3-4b-q4k-v2.vindex \
  --backends cpu --engine unlimited-context -n 32
```

Recorded baseline (2026-05-16, 8-thread, ~70-token ctx after warmup):

```
embed       ≈ 0.0 ms    ( 0%)
attention   ≈ 11.0 ms   (30%)  ← grows linearly with ctx
ffn         ≈ 26.1 ms   (70%)  ← flat regardless of ctx
total       ≈ 37.1 ms          ↔ 26.9 tok/s decode steady-state
```

**Acceptance for C12 Phase 1 (FFN hand-asm)**: at the same prompt/ctx, FFN drops from 26 → ≤15 ms (Phase 1 spec predicts ≥1.7× on gate/up/down, which would put FFN-alone at ~15 ms). Attention is the second-tier target after FFN is profile-clear; pre-Phase-1 it accounts for too little of the budget to bother with.

**Cool-machine protocol**: the M3 Max throttles on sustained Q4K matvec; a hot-bench reading can show 1.5-3× regressions that aren't real. Treat any kernel-A vs kernel-B comparison as inconclusive unless both runs start from a >5 min idle, and both `attention` and `ffn` rows move in the predicted direction (kernel work that improves only one should explain why).

## ADR-019 — MoE substrate decision (resolved 2026-05-09)

**Status**: **Resolved 2026-05-09** — Option A-modified. Substrate-primary
is dense (Gemma 4 31B); MoE coverage retained at single-machine scale;
multi-machine MoE grid demoted from P0 to P2.

### Resolution

**Decision**: Substrate-primary model is **Gemma 4 31B dense + vindex**.
MoE coverage is retained at single-machine scale (Gemma 4 26B-A4B for
cross-arch validation, virtual-expert work on existing MoE models, V1/V2
cross-arch sweeps). The multi-machine MoE grid (C9 productionisation,
critical-path items 5–10) drops to P2.

**Why not pure Option A** (drop MoE entirely): VID4 (virtual expert on
GPT-OSS) is already shipped publicly; the field is MoE (DeepSeek-V3,
Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS family); V1/V2 must measure both dense and
MoE for honest cross-arch claims. Dropping MoE would forfeit
substrate-relevant ground.

**Why not pure Option B** (keep grid at P0): Multi-machine MoE grid is
substantial production-engineering work with no current experiment
requiring "model spans 4 consumer machines" beyond what single-machine
sharding already demonstrates. Critical-path items 5–10
(RemoteExpertBackend, `/v1/expert/*` endpoints, `--experts` flag,
reliability pass) are production-engine concerns the substrate framing
explicitly excludes.

### Forcing factors that drove the decision

- **Video pipeline MoE-specificity**: VID4 already shipped. VID7 ("I
  killed attention") needs static-attention measurement that works on
  any arch — not MoE-specific. No upcoming video requires multi-machine.
- **V1–V4 grid-dependency**: Single-machine is sufficient for V1, V2, V3
  on Gemma 4 26B-A4B (3.8B active params fits in 64 GB consumer RAM
  comfortably). V4 (compound test) does not need multi-machine for the
  acceptance bar. Multi-machine becomes relevant only at the *Ultimate*
  acceptance tier (671B-class), which is the ~30%-confidence stretch (revised 2026-05-31).
- **MCP / lazarus parity**: Arch-neutral. No MoE dependency.
- **Vindex framing**: "vindex is MoE taken to its logical extreme, every
  fact is its own expert" (April 2026 thread). Multi-machine MoE
  engineering doesn't accelerate the dense + vindex experimental program.

### Stays at original priority (not affected by ADR-019)

- **C1 (MoE-aware CPU forward pass)** — required by V1/V2 cross-arch sweep on Gemma 4 26B-A4B. Stays P0 in CPU track.
- **Critical-path #1, #2, #3, #4** — chat template/EOS, CLI streaming, per-layer FFN format, CPU MoE forward pass. Items 1–2 unblock Act 1; #3 shipped; #4 = C1.
- **VID4 (virtual expert)** — already shipped publicly; demonstrates single-machine expert dispatch.
- **Demo Act 3 ("replace an expert")** — works on single-machine via VID4-style approach.
- **MTP1–MTP6** — Gemma 4 MTP drafter work spans both dense (31B) and MoE (26B-A4B) targets.
- **All V1–V4 aim-validation tests** — unaffected; cross-arch coverage was always part of the design.

### Re-opening clause

C9 and critical-path #5–10 re-promote to P0 if any of:
1. A specific experiment requires multi-machine expert dispatch (none currently).
2. A frontier model release (671B-class or larger) becomes substrate-relevant.
3. The Ultimate acceptance tier in "P0 — CPU path to blazing" becomes a near-term goal rather than a stretch.

## P1 — Gemma 4 MTP drafter support (promoted from P2 2026-05-09)

Driver: Google released MTP drafters for every Gemma 4 variant on
**2026-05-05** (see Current state bullet above). Apple Silicon decode
speedup measured at **~2.2× at speculative batch 4–8**. Ollama already
supports MTP out-of-the-box; without this, the LARQL gap on Gemma 4
widens from 1.17× to ~2.6× as users adopt the drafters.

The drafters are the *exact* models LARQL is built around:
`google/gemma-4-{E2B,E4B,26B-A4B,31B}-it-assistant`. Apache 2.0 (code) +
CC-BY-4.0 (weights). The 26B-A4B drafter is 0.4B BF16 (~4 layers).

Architecture (from Google blog + ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/mtp + the X
explainer thread):

1. Drafter shares the **input embedding table** with the target model.
2. Drafter consumes the target's **last-layer activations** at each
   accepted position, concatenates them with the next token embedding,
   and **down-projects to drafter dimension**.
3. Drafter cross-attends to the target's **global-layer KV cache** —
   specifically the *final* layer's KV, which is always global in
   Gemma 4 (the architecture interleaves local sliding-window attention
   with global attention, sliding window is 512 for E2B/E4B, 1024 for
   26B-A4B/31B). Local-sliding-window layer KVs are NOT shared.
4. E2B/E4B variants add an "Efficient Embedder" clustering layer that
   restricts drafter computation to selected token clusters.

**Substrate connection (added 2026-05-09)**: MTP exploits exactly the
attention-staticity that the "I Killed Attention" video (VID7) claims.
Per-token acceptance rate over a corpus is a direct measurement of the
static-attention fraction VID7 claims, *per architecture*. So MTP1–MTP6
produces both:
- A baseline-credibility number (Ollama parity on Gemma 4)
- Substrate evidence (VID7's central thesis at scale, per-arch)

Treat MTP6 as a substrate-and-baseline item, not just a competitive-parity
item. See Video pipeline section above.

CPU path reuses M1–M4 capture infrastructure. Metal path needs a dedicated lightweight last-residual tap during verify forward (M6 explicitly excludes Metal `generate` from hooks for performance reasons). The tap is one read from the residual buffer at the end of the last layer, before unembed — cheaper than full M1 plumbing. New Metal kernel: concatenate-and-project (or two separate dispatches if fusion regresses, ADR-015 lesson). **Activation extraction layer choice: validate against R6 depth-fraction probes** — Google reads from layer N by architectural choice; if R6 says discriminative information matures at 0.85·N, there is potentially free quality improvement available. |

**Implementation order**: MTP1 → MTP2 → **R6** → MTP3 → MTP4 → MTP6 (validate
2.2× number AND collect VID7 evidence) → MTP5 (E2B/E4B optimisation)
→ SD1 (generalise) → SD2 (EAGLE-3 drop-in).

**Acceptance**: Gemma 4 26B-A4B Metal decode goes from 19.4 tok/s to
≥35 tok/s at speculative batch 4–8 with bit-identical token output vs
no-MTP baseline (Google guarantees identical-quality output; verify with
parity test across the existing cross-arch corpus).

**Why P1 not critical-path**: doesn't block the demo (Acts 1–3) — but
it *does* block any future tok/s comparison with Ollama on Gemma 4. If
the comparison story matters, MTP1–MTP4 should land before any public
benchmark refresh.

## P1 — Boundary refs and cold-context storage

Driver: replace unbounded KV retention in long-context and multi-host scenarios
with compact, contract-bearing residual checkpoints. Hot KV window stays bounded;
older context is represented as 2564-byte compressed residual frames.

```
KV for the present. Residual boundaries for memory.
```

Foundation: `crates/larql-boundary/` (Phases 1–3 shipped).
Protocol spec: `~/chris-source/chris-experiments/shannon/43_residual_stream_codec/BOUNDARY_REF_PROTOCOL.md`.
Calibration data: `~/chris-source/chris-experiments/shannon/44_boundary_gate_calibration/`.

The existing `BoundaryStore` in `larql-inference/src/trace/boundary.rs` stores raw
bf16 residuals. `larql-boundary` adds the 2× compressed path on top of it. Phase 4
connects them to the running server.

**What D-@high actually contracts:** first ~5 continuation tokens safe at 4.8%
early-div (95% CI 1.6%–10.7%, n=62). Total 20-token divergence is ~20% regardless
of threshold — cascade compounds past step 5. Use for boundary-to-fresh-decode; not
for long uninterrupted continuation. See BOUNDARY_REF_PROTOCOL §6.

**Connection to KU2 (softmax bottleneck)**: BR4 is the workaround for the
softmax bottleneck phase transition at ~1,142-token RoPE distance.
Q-side drift is fixable; KV-side drift at last position is not, with
current architecture. BR4 evicts hot KV before the bottleneck triggers
and falls back to compressed residual frames for older context.

**Immediate unblocking item:** BR4 (Phase 4 server integration). The eviction
ordering decision (durability-first Option A: capture → gate → fsync → evict KV)
is specified in the protocol; implementation in `larql-server` can start from it
directly.

## P1 — Spec'd implementations, sequenced behind P0 validation

Driver: two implementation tracks have shipped specs and review cycles but
are deliberately queued behind V1–V4 / R6 / MTP / BR4. Recording the
sequencing here so they don't drift to the front of the queue on momentum

(b) **A video script or research workflow that needs paraphrase-reach compiled facts above the L1 i16 cos≥0.999 threshold.** None currently does — VID1/Act 3/VID4 all use different mechanisms. (c) Optionally: a deployment scenario where K_layer is large enough that the §5.4 break-even is comfortable (current decode K is 256–1024; at K=1024, h=0.20, crossover is N<410 — admissible but not a clear wall-clock win on small fact corpora). | ~2 weeks once unblocked. Greenfield (decorator + cache + endpoint + COMPILE wiring). |

**Why these are queued, not P0/P1-active**

- **SQ1 (Markov)**: contract is sound, reference impl already works, but
  it's engineering not research — and the open trait-shape question
  means migrating Markov first risks forcing
  `UnlimitedContextEngine`/`ApolloEngine` into a shape that doesn't fit.
  Designing the trait once across all three engines (or at least
  resolving sibling-vs-trait before SQ1 lands) is cheaper than migrating
  one and refactoring twice. V1/V2 also produce the measurement
  infrastructure that lets the migration prove parity.
- **SQ2 (FFN lookup)**: the §5.4 cost model says it's a wash on the
  configurations LARQL actually runs at typical K (256–1024) without
  large compiled-fact corpora (>410 entries at K=1024, h=0.20). Building
  it now means it sits unused until a future video script needs
  paraphrase-reach. R6 also unblocks the per-arch layer-policy table —
  building SQ2 before R6 means re-doing the layer calibration manually
  for each architecture.

**Re-promotion conditions** (any one promotes that item to active P1):

- SQ1: V1/V2 land **and** trait-vs-sibling decision recorded in an ADR.
- SQ2: R6 lands **and** a specific video/experiment requires
  paraphrase-reach compiled facts (i.e. the L1 cos≥0.999 cache is
  measurably leaving paraphrases on the floor in that workflow).

**The fact that the specs are written is itself the work**

Both specs went through 2–3 review cycles and caught real issues that
would otherwise have surfaced as wall-clock surprises (the §5.4 algebra
error in particular: a refusal rule of `N > 2K` instead of
`N > 2*h*K` would have green-lit configurations that are net-negative
by ~5× at typical hit rates). The remaining work is implementation
under contract, not design — so when SQ1 or SQ2 do become active P1,
they start from a much better place than typical greenfield work.

## P1 — Generation UX (parallel to critical path)

Details in `larql-inference/ROADMAP.md` and `larql-cli/ROADMAP.md`.

- Sampling: `--temperature`, `--top-p`, `--top-k`, `--repetition-penalty`
- Multi-turn state: running KV across `larql chat` turns
- Long context: `--max-context N`, dynamic KV buffer growth
- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` (after streaming lands)
- Auto-extract on `larql run hf://owner/name`
- Gemma 3 4B regression smoke test (gate on `CI_INTEGRATION=1`)

---

## P2 — Film checklist

- [ ] Confirm Gemma 4 26B A4B public config (expert count, top-K, active-param figure, GQA ratio). Replace every `~` in `docs/demo-script-gemma4-moe.md`.
- [ ] Measure real footprint + latency on `google/gemma-4-31b-it` for Act 1.
- [ ] Reliability pass on `RemoteWalkBackend` (timeouts, retries, partial shard outage). **(P2 per ADR-019.)**
- [ ] `RemoteExpertBackend` same reliability pass. **(P2 per ADR-019.)**
- [ ] Decide repo-public date. `cargo install larql-cli && larql serve` must be live the week the video drops.
- [ ] Pick expert IDs for the Act 3 swap shot — one that fires on medical prompts, one that doesn't.
- [x] ~~Resolve ADR-019 before final Act 2 / Act 3 commitments.~~ Resolved 2026-05-09.

## P2 — Competitive parity (positioning analysis 2026-05-09)

Driver: items surfaced by [docs/positioning.md](docs/positioning.md) that the
ollama / vLLM / llama.cpp comparison treats as table stakes but LARQL doesn't
yet ship.

**Re-evaluated 2026-05-09 under the substrate framing** (see "Engine purpose"
above). Each item is now scored by *"does this affect the credibility of
measured technique deltas, or accelerate experiments?"* Items that only serve
"becoming a production engine" are explicitly **dropped or deferred** — LARQL
will never be a production engine, so spending engineering on production-engine
features that don't tighten the experiment loop is scope creep.

| `BaseVindex` trait + `PatchedVindex` composition (ADR-worthy) | larql-vindex  | `patch/{overlay.rs, overlay_apply.rs, format.rs, knn_store.rs}` ≈ 2.6k LOC mirrors `format/load.rs` (~640 LOC). Introduce a `BaseVindex` trait so the read-only loader and the overlay path share dtype/quant decode; today both reimplement it. Targets ~1k LOC reduction in `patch/` and one source of truth for weight decode. |
